Trump drops Steve Bannon from National Security Council,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump removed his chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council on Wednesday, reversing his controversial decision early this year to give a political adviser an unprecedented role in security discussions. Trump’s overhaul of the NSC, confirmed by a White House official, also elevated General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence who heads all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. The official said the change moves the NSC “back to its core function of what it’s supposed to do.” It also appears to mark a victory for national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who had told some national security experts he felt he was in a “battle to the death” with Bannon and others on the White House staff. Vice President Mike Pence said Bannon would continue to play an important role in policy and played down the shake-up as routine. “This is just a natural evolution to ensure the National Security Council is organized in a way that best serves the president in resolving and making those difficult decisions,” Pence said on Fox News.  Bannon said in a statement he had succeeded in returning the NSC back to its traditional role of coordinating foreign policy rather than running it. He cited President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, for why he advocated a change. “Susan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration so I was put on NSC to ensure it was ‘de-operationalized.’ General McMaster has NSC back to its proper function,” he said. Trump’s White House team has grappled with infighting and intrigue that has hobbled his young presidency. In recent days, several other senior U.S. foreign policy and national security officials have said the mechanisms for shaping the Trump administration’s response to pressing challenges such as Syria, North Korea and Iran still were not in place.  Critics of Bannon’s role on the NSC said it gave too much weight in decision-making to someone who lacked foreign policy expertise. Bannon, who was chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign in the months leading to his election in November, in some respects represents Trump’s “America First” nationalistic voice, helping fuel his anti-Washington fervor and pushing for the president to part ways at times with mainstream Republicans. Before joining the Trump administration, Bannon headed Breitbart News, a right-wing website. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called the shift in the NSC a positive step that will help McMaster “gain control over a body that was being politicized by Bannon’s involvement.” “As the administration’s policy over North Korea, China, Russia and Syria continues to drift, we can only hope this shake-up brings some level of strategic vision to the body,” he said. Bannon’s removal from the NSC was a potential setback for his sphere of influence in the Trump White House, where he has a voice in most major decisions. But a Trump confidant said Bannon remained as influential as ever. “He is still involved in everything and still has the full confidence of the president but to be fair he can only do so much stuff,” the confidant said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The White House official said Bannon was no longer needed on the NSC after the departure of Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 over his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, prior to Trump taking office on Jan. 20. The official said Bannon had been placed on the NSC originally as a check on Flynn and had only attended one of the NSC’s regular meetings. The official dismissed questions about a power struggle between Bannon and McMaster, saying they shared the same world view. However, two current national security officials rejected the White House explanation, noting that two months have passed since Flynn’s departure. McMaster, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also has dueled with Bannon and others over direct access to Trump; the future of deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News commentator; intelligence director Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Flynn appointee; and other staffing decisions. Trump is preparing for his first face-to-face meeting on Thursday and Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping with the threat of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs a key component of their talks. Bannon’s seat on the NSC’s “principals’ committee,” a group that includes the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides, was taken by Rick Perry, who as energy secretary is charged with overseeing the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal.

Puerto Rico expects U.S. to lift Jones Act shipping restrictions,"(Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Wednesday he expected the federal government to waive the Jones Act, which would lift restrictions on ships that can provide aid to the island devastated by Hurricane Maria. He said he has been speaking with members of Congress from both parties who have supported an emergency waiver.      “We expect them to waive it,” Rossello said in an interview with CNN. He noted there was a seven-day waiver after Hurricane Irma, which was much less devastating to the island.     On Tuesday, the Trump administration said there was no need to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying it would do nothing to address the island’s damaged ports, the main impediment to shipping. A waiver would allow Puerto Rico to get help not only from U.S. ships but from any ships that can bring aid.     “That is critical, particularly for fuel,” he said. “One of the considerations right now is the priority of getting fuel, diesel, gasoline, all across the island. Right now we have enough fuel. We’re limited by the transportation logistics, but at some point of course, getting fuel into the island is going to be critical so that we can have the major functions of telecoms, hospitals, water, to be running appropriately.”     The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American owned-and-operated ships. U.S. Senator John McCain asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke on Tuesday to grant an emergency waiver of the law. He said that Puerto Rican residents would have to pay at least twice as much for food, drinking water and other supplies without the waiver. (This corrected version of the story fixes paragraph four to show the administration has not formally denied a waiver request). ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2017 ",1
 OOPS: Trump Just Accidentally Confirmed He Leaked Israeli Intelligence To Russia (VIDEO),"On Monday, Donald Trump once again embarrassed himself and his country by accidentally revealing the source of the extremely classified information he leaked to Russia earlier this month.While it was speculated that the source of the information was Israel, Trump made things crystal clear during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. President Pussygrabber explained that he never   not once   said  Israel  during his conversation with the Russian recipients of the leaked information. Not a single time. Just so you understand I never mentioned the word or the name  Israel,  Trump said.  I never mentioned it during that conversation. They were all saying I did,  Trump said, gesturing to reporters.  So you had another story wrong. Never mentioned the word  Israel . He may not have said the word Israel,  but according to reports Israeli intelligence officials  were shouting at US counterparts  over the leaked information.Now, he accidentally-perhaps-on-purpose confirmed where it came from.Watch it happen below:President Trump says he  never mentioned the word Israel  in his Oval Office meeting with Russian officials https://t.co/84ZCW64hcE  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 22, 2017Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 22, 2017",0
Donald Trump heads for Scotland to reopen a golf resort,"GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Most U.S. presidential candidates go abroad to sharpen their foreign policy credentials. Donald Trump arrives in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort. The presumptive Republican nominee, 70, visits his family’s ancestral homeland to showcase his far-flung business empire. His mother was born on Scotland’s Isle of Lewis. With a throng of reporters watching, he will make a dramatic arrival by helicopter at his seaside Trump Turnberry resort. He has scheduled a news conference on the 9th hole at noon (7 a.m. ET/1100 GMT). His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, will allow him to comment on the outcome of Britain’s vote on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union. “I don’t think opening a golf resort gets you many foreign policy chops,” said Saul Anuzis, former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. “But since he’s there right in the middle of the EU vote, it may end up being a PR bonanza for him.” The risk is that the real-estate tycoon, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, will make a foreign policy misstep at a time when Republican leaders are urging a more serious demeanor. Trump has said he would be inclined to leave the EU. He has exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has called the New Yorker’s anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. There are no plans for the two to meet. His trip has baffled Republican officials who say he should concentrate on strengthening his campaign and taking the fight to the presumptive Democratic nominee, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is 68. Trump defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination but has faced one controversy after another, the latest over his firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. “His campaign has got all kinds of growing pains and it doesn’t make sense that he would spend any kind of time going out of the country,” said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.  Turnberry is a storied course where the Open Championship has been staged four times. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotland’s West Coast 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow. He has portrayed his determination to build up courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen and overcome local opposition as an example of the type of leadership skills that Americans would get if he wins the White House on Nov. 8. “Well, Scotland has already been won – and so will the United States,” Trump wrote in a column for The Press and Journal newspaper in Aberdeen. An Aberdeen family opposed to his development there has threatened to raise a Mexican flag as a reminder of his proposal to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally. The last Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in 2012 made a gaffe-filled campaign trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
 Paul Ryan Responds To Dem’s Sit-In On Gun Control In The Most DISGUSTING Way (VIDEO),"On Wednesday, Democrats took a powerful stance against the GOP s refusal to vote on gun control measures by staging a sit-in. While Republican politicians called a recess and took a lunch break, Dems stayed put on the floor and fought for the safety of America s citizens.Hours after the sit-in, House Speaker Paul Ryan weighed in on the event in an interview with CNN, and his comments were just as disappointing as they were disgusting. His response to a sit-in, which follows the deaths of almost 50 innocent Americans that lost their lives in a tragic mass shooting in Orlando a week ago, was this brutal sentence: This is nothing more than a publicity stunt. Seriously   a genuine attempt to get Congress to support gun control measures that will protect American citizens from senseless gun violence like mass shootings is considered a  publicity stunt  by a leading Republican. The Speaker of the House added that the Democrats involved in the sit-in were trying to rob Americans of their rights, insisting that we should not be focusing on gun control and that the real threat is terrorism. In saying this, Ryan has completely ignored the fact that there have been several mass shootings in the United States that have zero connection to terrorism and were caused by individuals that never should have been able to get their hands on a gun so effortlessly.To prove just how backwards Ryan s  logic  is, he accused the hard-working Democrats fighting for gun control legislation of doing the sit-in for  attention  instead of creating solutions (clearly, he forgot that his GOP colleagues were EATING LUNCH while this was happening   which definitely doesn t solve anything). When Wolf Blitzer asked Ryan if it was the NRA that was the major obstacle standing in the way of gun control legislation, Ryan said, No, the Constitution is  because Americans have a  guaranteed  Second Amendment right to firearms.You can watch Ryan s horrific comments below:The entire interview is infuriating, but truly proves that the GOP cares more about guns than Americans  right to safety.Featured image via Allison Shelley / Getty Images",News,"June 22, 2016",0

Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party may be the most disliked member of the European Parliment.

North Korea shows no sign it is serious about talking: U.S. official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department said Wednesday that the United States would be open to talking to North Korea  when the time is right  but that it could not happen now because Pyongyang has shown no sign of a willingness to halt its missile and nuclear testing. Despite U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson s offer on Tuesday to start talks with North Korea without pre-conditions, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said there would first have to be a  period of calm  in which Pyongyang suspends  testing before any negotiations could begin. Tillerson, in a speech to a Washington think tank on Tuesday, did not explicitly establish such a freeze as a requirement that North Korea must meet ahead of talks. Nauert, speaking at the State Department s daily briefing, insisted that Tillerson was not establishing new policy in his speech, even though he appeared to back away from a key U.S. demand that Pyongyang must first accept that any negotiations would have to be about giving up its nuclear arsenal.

New Jersey's Christie mulls run to lead Republican Party: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, an early supporter of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is considering a run to lead the Republican National Committee, Politico reported on Thursday. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report, and representatives for Christie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Christie, whose term as governor ends in January 2018, had been leading Trump’s transition team until U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence recently took over earlier this month. Current RNC Chairman Reince Priebus has been tapped to serve as Trump’s chief of staff when he starts his White House term Jan. 20, 2017. Christie had launched a presidential bid alongside Trump in a pool of 17 candidates that eventually saw Trump, a New York businessman who had never held political office, win the nomination as well as the Nov. 8 presidential election over Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Christie had been a rising political star before the so-called “Bridgegate” scandal involving his former top aides that left his reputation in tatters.   Pence took over from Christie, who at one time had been considered a possible candidate to serve as Trump’s attorney general, a post that instead went to U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Trump’s team has said Christie would remain as vice chair of the transition effort. Earlier this month, Christie’s two former aides were convicted for shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in 2013, creating a days-long traffic jam. The scheme was intended to punish the town’s mayor, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Christie’s reelection campaign. ",politicsNews,"December 1, 2016 ",1

U.S. gives Laos extra $90 million to help clear unexploded ordnance,"VIENTIANE (Reuters) - The United States announced on Tuesday it would provide an additional $90 million over the next three years to help Laos, heavily bombed during the Vietnam War, clear unexploded ordnance that has killed or injured more than 20,000 people. The figure announced during President Barack Obama’s first visit to Laos is close to the $100 million the United States has spent in the past 20 years on clearing its UXO in Laos. From 1964 to 1973, U.S. warplanes dropped more than 270 million cluster munitions on the communist country, one-third of which did not explode, the Lao National Regulatory Authority for UXO says. Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Laos when he arrived in the once-isolated country on Monday to attend two regional summits, half a century after America’s “secret war” left Laos with the unfortunate distinction of being the most heavily bombed country, per capita, in history. The White House said in a statement U.S. programs in Laos had helped slash UXO casualties from 300 to less than 50 a year and the additional funding would be used for a “comprehensive UXO survey of Laos and for continued clearing operations”. “The United States is helping Laos clear unexploded ordnance, which poses a threat to people and hampers economic development,” it said. The package would help support UXO victims needing rehabilitation, including orthotics and prosthetics, it added. Obama, in a speech on Tuesday in the capital, Vientiane, addressed the secret war. “As a result of that conflict many people fled or were driven from their homes,” Obama said. “At the time America did not acknowledge its role.” “I believe the United States has a moral obligation to help Laos heal.” UXO remains a stubborn problem in the region and experts say it could take decades to clear landmines and bombs in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, which were beset by conflicts in the 1960s and 1970s, and in Cambodia’s case, in the 1980s and 1990s too. In the central Lao province of Xieng Khouang, the area most heavily bombed by U.S. aircraft during the war in neighboring Vietnam, there is a trail of devastation. About 80 percent of the people of landlocked Laos rely on agriculture, but some of it is simply too dangerous to farm. Approximately a quarter of its villages are contaminated with unexploded ordnance, says the British-based Mines Advisory Group, which helps find and destroy the bombs. On Wednesday, Obama is expected to visit an organization in Vientiane that works with those disabled by unexploded ordnance, the Cooperative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise Visitor Center.

JUDGE DECLARES BABY NAME “Illegal” To Prevent Her From “Emotional Harm”,"Does a judge have the right to determine what a mother and or father names their child? Don t think for one minute in this politically correct environment we re living in, this couldn t happen right here in the United States Some names are so bizarre, we can t believe they ve ever been given to children. But a recent landmark case just went a step further by telling a mother she can t give her newborn twins the names she chose.The mother, who is from Powys, Wales, attempted to name her offspring  Cyanide  and  Preacher.  She believed  Cyanide  was a pretty name for a little girl with positive implications since it s the poison that killed both Hitler and his follower Joseph Goebbels, according to Metro. She also argued that she had the right to name her own children. However, Justice Eleanor King ruled that the name could cause emotional harm to the child in the future. It is hard to see how the twin girl could regard being named after this deadly poison as other than a complete rejection of her by her birth mother,  said King.The twins, now 8 months old, were reportedly conceived of rape. They were placed in foster care, along with their three half-siblings, due to the mother s history of mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse.Social workers from Powys County Council brought the case to the British Appeal Court. An injunction had previously been issued to prevent the mother from formally registering the names. This is one of those rare cases where the court should intervene to protect the girl twin from emotional harm,  said King. Via: MSN ",left-news,"May 4, 2016",0
 Paul Ryan Takes A Monumentally HUMILIATING Photo With A Constituent Who EXPERTLY Trolled Him (IMAGE),"Politicians are all about photo-ops.

" Republicans Dine With Trump, Then Try To Railroad Comey Into Clearing Him (VIDEO)","Republicans are once again putting their party before their country. Just before the highly anticipated testimony from fired FBI Director James Comey, GOP Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Tom Cotton (R-AL) went scurrying down to the White House like good little Republican sycophants to have dinner with Donald Trump.Nevermind the optics of this, nevermind the fact that it is at best highly inappropriate to put themselves into a situation where Trump might try to lean on them to go in a certain direction with their questioning of Comey   none of that mattered to these two sniveling weasels. All they cared about was currying favor with their so-called  president,  and trying to cast him in as decent a light as possible.These slimy tactics showed in their lines of questioning of Comey on Thursday as well. Instead of focusing on Comey s conversations with Trump, and on Trump s inappropriate, unethical, and possibly illegal behavior, Rubio decided to focus instead on leaks, saying to Comey: You know, this investigation is full of leaks, left and right. Do you ever wonder why of all the things in this investigation the only thing that s never been leaked is the fact that the president was not personally under investigation, despite the fact that both Democrats and Republicans in the leadership of Congress knew that and have known that for weeks? Comey, unfazed by Rubio s clear attempt to force him to make Trump look good, simply said,  I don t know. Here is video of that exchange:Cotton s tactics were even slimier. He went after Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) regarding statements she had made regarding the Russia matter during television appearances months ago. He reminded Comey and America that at the time, Senator Feinstein had said on national television that she saw no evidence of Team Trump having worked with the Russians. Cotton then asked Comey how he felt about those statements. Again, Comey didn t take the bait, and said: I don t doubt that Sen. Feinstein was saying what she understood. Here is video of that exchange:Considering what we know about Trump s penchant for pressuring people, it is entirely possible that at that dinner, Rubio and Cotton made some kind of loyalty pledge. It was clear from the questioning that these two Senators had one goal and one goal only: to clear Trump of any wrongdoing   be it legally or for political benefit in the minds of the American public.So, there you have it, folks. The GOP cares more about their party than they do their country. They don t care if there are Russian stooges in the White House   just since those stooges are members of their party.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 8, 2017",0
U.S. House panel offers alternative to retirement adviser rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to bypass the U.S. Labor Department and have Congress set standards for brokers who give retirement advice passed a major committee on Wednesday and is now headed to the full House of Representatives. Although the bill faces slim chances of becoming law, it reveals the depth of feuding in Washington over the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law’s requirement that retirement advisers follow a “fiduciary” standard that puts their clients’ interests first. The requirement aims to end potential conflicts of interest by brokers who advise on individual retirement accounts and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products that line brokers’ pockets.  Last week, the Labor Department sent a revised proposal for an adviser rule to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Details will not be made public until the White House completes its review. This was the department’s second stab at a rule. Wide criticism from the industry and lawmakers alike forced it to withdraw its initial proposal in 2011.  The House Ways and Means Committee split along party lines as it debated the legislation, which would create a “best interest requirement” and lay out processes for advisers to follow.  Republicans, the majority, touted it as a workable alternative to the Labor Department’s rule, which they said could “frighten off” middle-income investors from seeking advice and give advisers incentives to work only for wealthy clients.  They took issue with how the Labor Department drafted its rule, as well, saying the first version was panned by thousands of people and complaining that the current version lacked transparency. “Just disclose it,” said Rep. Peter Roskam, of Illinois, who helped write the bill, in comments directed at the department. “You’ve written it. It’s done. It’s not holy text.” Democrats said lawmakers should wait to see the Labor Department’s rule before bypassing it. They also complained there were no hearings on the bill, introduced in December, and said industry pressure was behind a sudden rush to pass it. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, would likely veto the legislation if it passed both the House and the Senate.

" This New Poll Is TERRIFIC News For Democrats, Really BAD NEWS For Trump","While Democratic and Republicans candidates continue to battle it out for who will win their respective nominations, new polling has suggested some very likely outcomes. It looks as though if Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, not only will it tear the GOP into shreds, but they also won t stand a chance of winning the general election in November.According to a new CNN/ORC poll, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would crush Donald Trump in the general election. In fact, the only candidate that may give either Democratic candidate a run for their money would be Marco Rubio, but so far in this primary process he has yet to win one state, so the chances of that happening are little to none. Clinton and Sanders would also beat Cruz, Carson and Kasich.It looks as though Hillary would best Trump 52 percent to 44 percent and Sanders 55 percent to 43 percent, and the pattern of polling suggests for both Democrats that this will only increase for both of them as the months go on. Needless to say, a Trump Republican nomination would handily lead to another Democrat in the White House.Here s the thing, though. To make sure of this much-needed defeat of Donald Trump, who is looking more and more like the potential nominee, liberals are going to need to unite behind whichever candidate gets the nomination. This would mean Hillary supporters backing Sanders, and Sanders supporters backing Hillary come November. Basically, no matter who   vote blue. Unless, of course, you d like to see a racist madman instill fascism into the nation, because in that case, by all means, stay home and have yourself a pity party.All things considered, it s looking remarkably good for Democrats and painfully desperate for Republicans. If Democrats are able to unite while the Republican party disintegrates before our very eyes, we will have a Democrat in the White House.Featured image: Instagram/Flickr/Flickr",News,"March 1, 2016",0
BOOM! KELLYANNE CONWAY Schools CNN’s Anderson Cooper On The Comey Firing [Video],"Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties.

"Trump, tech tycoons talk overhaul of H1B visas"," NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team has been actively considering ways to revamp a temporary visa program used to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill high-skilled jobs, according to sources familiar with the discussions.  Possibilities for reforming the distribution of H-1B visas, which are used largely by the tech industry, were discussed at a meeting last month with chief executives of tech companies at Trump Tower, said two sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to talk about the closed-door talks.  DON’T MISS Pharma grapples with drug price backlash DOJ to examine FBI actions in Clinton email probe Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller proposed scrapping the existing lottery system used to award the visas. A possible replacement system would favor visa petitions for jobs that pay the highest salaries, according to the sources.  H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in “specialty” occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 65,000 every year.  Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that say those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications.  The H-1B visa program tends to be more critical to outsourcing firms than U.S. tech firms. For instance, more than 60 percent of the U.S. employees of Indian outsourcing firm Infosys (INFY.NS) are H-1B holders, and the company in its annual report has cited an increase in visa costs as among factors that could hurt its profitability.  The top 10 recipients of H-1B visas in 2015 were all outsourcing firms, according to government data compiled by the IEEE-USA, a professional organization representing U.S. engineers.  Sixty-five percent of H-1B petitions approved in the 2014 fiscal year went to tech workers, mostly from India, according to USCIS.  In several high-profile cases, American workers were asked to train H-1B holders to do their jobs before being laid off themselves.  The idea advanced by Miller in the tech meeting has also been pushed by the IEEE-USA.  Miller previously served as a staffer for Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, who has been an outspoken critic of abuses of the H-1B program.  Trump, who has applied for H-1B visas to bring in foreign workers to his own businesses sent mixed messages about the program on the campaign trail. He assailed it for taking jobs from U.S. workers, but during a Republican debate last March said he was “softening” his position “because we have to have talented people in this country.”  He later issued a statement on his website saying he would “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.”  Trump businesses, like Trump National Golf Club and Trump Model Management, have received permission to bring in more than two dozen foreign employees on H-1B visas since 2011, according to Department of Labor data.  During the meeting last month in New York, Trump seemed to be searching for middle ground, and members of his transition team raised specific proposals, the two sources said. A third source familiar with the talks said the Trump team has also discussed the plan to change the lottery system internally.  There were more than a dozen top tech executives from some of the country’s largest tech companies, including Google (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), present at the meeting.  Microsoft (MSFT.O) CEO Satya Nadella said technology companies need to be able to recruit talent from abroad when necessary.  Trump seemed open to modifying the H-1B program, the sources said. He said he wanted to stop “bad people” from immigrating to the United States, not “great people,” according to one account of the meeting.  Among proposals the group discussed was raising the cost of applications from large companies as a way to discourage bulk filing for the visas. Asked by Trump if they would object to that, none of the tech CEOs said they would.  “In our view, the president-elect is not hostile to H-1B visas,” said one of the sources familiar with discussions at the meeting.  While Trump could initiate some changes to the visa program with executive action, significant shifts would likely need to go through a lengthy formal rulemaking process, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert at Cornell Law School. Major changes would likely be subject to court challenges, he said.  Other reforms, like changing the visa cap or offering more green cards to high-tech workers, could require Congressional action, Yale-Loehr said.  A wide variety of companies, including Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), use the H-1B visa program to bring in employees from abroad.  ",politicsNews,"January 12, 2017 ",1
"Governor of Yemen's interim capital resigns, accuses PM of corruption","ADEN (Reuters) - The governor of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s interim capital Aden has resigned, citing what he said was government corruption that had undermined his efforts to restore basic services to the city. Abdulaziz al-Muflehi s resignation just six months after his appointment deals a blow to Hadi s government as it pushes its fight against the Iran-aligned Houthis who have seized much of northern Yemen since late 2014, forcing Hadi into exile. Officials from Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government denies charges of corruption and says it operates according to high standards of transparency. In a lengthy letter sent to Hadi, Muflehi said he had intended to focus on infrastructure building and activating state bodies such as the judiciary and police when he assumed office in May.  Unfortunately, I found myself caught in a bitter war against a huge camp of corruption whose brigades are well trained and fortifications are protected by guards led by Prime Minister Dr. Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr,  Muflehi wrote in his resignation letter, a copy of which was sent to Reuters. The letter was also published by local media, including online newspapers Aden News and Aden al-Ghad. As an example, he said bin Daghr had transferred more than 5.787 billion riyals ($13.4 million) from the province s account to the Communications Ministry, saying he wanted to give Yemen an internet service that rivals advanced countries. Muflehi said the country first needed to restore electricity services to areas like Aden, and said the move  hides avidities and corruption .  Muflehi had spent much of his time outside Aden since he was appointed by Hadi in May to replace Aydaroos al-Zubaydi, a local militia commander who had thrown his weight behind secessionists demanding the restoration of the former South Yemen that merged with the tribal north in 1990. Southerners have regularly complained of the domination of the more populous north in the union, including allegations of seizure of real estate and forced retirement of civil servants and military personnel under former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was forced to step down after mass protests in 2011. Hadi s government had pledged to restore sacked civil servants and military personnel and pay back salaries they had complained had been denied to them, but the outbreak of civil war in 2015 has derailed the plans.

"U.S. military can withstand the sage grouse, lawmakers say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to protect the greater sage grouse, a bird found in the western United States, do not pose a threat to the U.S. military, two senior Democratic House of Representatives lawmakers said on Tuesday. Debate over the bird was intense a year ago when the House Armed Services Committee was finalizing its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the $600 billion  annual bill setting out U.S. defense policy. Arguing that protecting the sage grouse would put large swaths of the western United States off limits for military training, House Republicans included a ban on making the bird an endangered species in the House version of the 2016 NDAA. The measure was stripped out as the bill was considered by the Senate and not in the legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama. But it is again in the House version of the 2017 NDAA, which the House armed services panel will debate on Wednesday. Representatives Adam Smith, the top Armed Services Democrat, and Raul Grijalva, his counterpart on the Natural Resources Committee, released letters from Department of Defense officials saying that land use plans intended to protect the bird will not affect military training, operations or readiness to any significant degree. “These letters put to bed once and for all the silly speculation that a few birds could hamstring the greatest fighting force in the history of the world,” Grijalva said in a statement.

 It Looks Like The Trump Campaign Just Got This Reporter Arrested,"While Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of being crooked and freedom hating, a member of the press was arrested at a his Houston rally after simply inquiring about press credentials.Alex Thompson of Vice News was arrested at the Omni Westside hotel for  trespassing.  Thompson, inquiring as to whether or not his pending press credentials had been approved or denied, entered the hotel lobby to ask members of Trump s communications staff what the final say was.According to Vice News:A man who identified himself as a hotel manager then asked Thompson to leave and warned that he would be arrested if he did not. Roughly two minutes later, without further warning and while Thompson was waiting for a member of Trump s staff to clarify his access to the event, he was arrested by Houston Police, handcuffed, and escorted outside. Thompson spoke with his editors while handcuffed and said that he was never given any opportunity to explain himself to police.And just like that, a reporter was arrested for requesting an answer to his ability to report on the rally, which is his constitutional right.Ryan McCarthy, editor-in-chief of Vice, tweeted:Our reporter @AlxThomp was arrested today outside a Trump event   for doing his job https://t.co/kS2PG5Igyc  Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) September 17, 2016Of course the Trump campaign denied any knowing or involvement of the incident, saying,  The campaign was not involved in this incident or aware of the details surrounding it. The event organizers were responsible for today s media presence and requested the campaign limit attendance to the traveling pool. Thompson was released on bond overnight, and the Houston police claimed that he issued an ultimatum: arrest him or leave him alone, because he is not leaving until he gets an answer, as he   a member of the press   is entitled to.Vice has hinted that their lawyers are working on getting the charges dropped.Given Trump and his campaign s hostility to the media (which includes threatening to sue the New York Times, tightening libel laws, and calling CNN panelists a bunch of losers), could having a reporter arrested seem too far out there? The answer is no.Whether or not Trump or anyone in his campaign made the call is not know. But we do know this much: the campaign had his credentials pending; he inquired but to no avail; he inquired again, and was arrested for  trespassing,  even though the event was public.Trump is no friend of the press, or the freedom of the press to report on the asinine and ridiculous things he and his supporters cough up. That should scare everyone.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"September 18, 2016",0
 Asian American Organizations RAIN HELL Upon Fox News For Racist Chinatown Segment,"Asian Americans are pissed off after Fox News ran a segment featuring racist Bill O Reilly goon Jesse Watters in Chinatown.O Reilly and Watters billed the edition of Watter s World as  good fun  and and mere  political humor. Watters literally strolled through New York City s Chinatown asking residents if they know karate and if they can  take care of North Korea for us.  Let s just say the segment pushed every stereotype about Asian people Watters and O Reilly could think of. Even O Reilly acknowledged that Fox News would get some letters.Here s the video via YouTube: [ad3media campaign= 1065 ]But they got WAY more than just some letters. The backlash has been swift and brutal as Asian American organizations from across the country condemn Fox News across the board for being so despicably and blatantly racist.Asian Americans Advancing Justice wrote, It is unconscionable that a news organization would sanction a segment that laughs at a community of people, including Watters ridiculing elderly Chinese Americans who were limited English proficient. Although The O Reilly Factor may believe this was  all in good fun,  the segment does nothing more than play up every offensive stereotype of Asian Americans that the community has fought against for decades. What they should have done is to talk about the important role that Asian Americans can play in this upcoming election. The Asian American Journalists Association also condemned the segment. The Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) is outraged and shocked by the Oct. 3rd segment of  Watters  World  on Fox News   The O Reilly Factor.  The segment was billed as a report on Chinese Americans  views on the U.S. presidential election but it was rife with racist stereotypes, drew on thoughtless tropes and openly ridiculed Asian Americans It s 2016. We should be far beyond tired, racist stereotypes and targeting an ethnic group for humiliation and objectification on the basis of their race. Sadly, Fox News proves it has a long way to go in reporting on communities of color in a respectful and fair manner. The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans also slammed Fox News. It is not  all in good fun  to perpetuate racist stereotypes about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and it certainly is not  gentle fun  to target or mock people who are not fluent in English. No person should be used as a prop in such a heartless manner. Asian And Pacific Islander American Vote chimed in as well.Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote (APIAVote) is appalled by the recent  Watters  World  segment on The O Reilly Factor on Chinese American voters. The segment exploited Asian American stereotypes and exemplified the very issue of China-bashing the report supposedly sought to assess. This racist and derogatory segment damages Chinese American and Asian American communities and exacerbates negative stereotypes towards our communities.It is clear that the intent of this segment began from a desire to employ racist stereotypes to ridicule and mock Chinese American voters, and was never a serious attempt to understand the preferences or opinions of these voters after the first presidential debate.In addition, the Asian American Legal Defense Fund also had words for Fox via Twitter.This racist mocking of people in NY #Chinatown makes clear that @FoxNews doesn t care about Asian American voters. https://t.co/uTfr8WkoME  AsianAmericanLegal (@aaldef) October 5, 2016The Organization of Chinese Americans had even stronger words. This segment was grossly offensive to Chinese Americans and all Asian Pacific Americans who have ever had to suffer through the many false equivocations and damaging stereotypes that were mentioned in rapid-fire succession during the show. By going to the Chinese American community under the auspices of journalism and then unleashing a barrage of offensive stereotypes, Bill O Reilly, Jesse Watters, and Fox News have completely trivialized the community s view on this important election. At a time when politicians have fallen back on xenophobia to get ahead in the polls, it is disheartening to hear such offensive behavior come out of the media even as our power in the political process grows. Fox News should immediately disavow the segment and apologize to the Chinese American community for making a mockery of their language, culture, and political views. Fox News had better offer a sincere apology soon because they clearly pissed off a large segment of the population. Bill O Reilly and Jesse Watters should be ashamed of themselves and they should be removed from the network. But that would require that anyone at Fox News has a conscience.Featured Image: Dangerous Minds",News,"October 6, 2016",0
OUCH! BUSH “BESTIE” Goes Against GOP Elites…ENDORSES TRUMP [VIDEO],"That s gonna leave a mark Former Vice President Dick Cheney will support Donald Trump, he told CNN Friday, an important move as the presumptive Republican nominee is encountering intense resistance from senior members of his own party.Cheney told CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel that he has always supported the GOP nominee and will do so this year as well.CNN tried to coerce Cheney into a Trump endorsement only one month ago. Cheney wisely chose to wait and see who the people of America chose to be their nominee. Watch:The announcement makes Cheney one of the few Republican Party elders to announce their support of Trump and comes a day after House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN he is  just not ready  to back Trump.The father-son duo have endorsed every GOP nominee since each of them left the White House, but it seems they ll draw the line with Trump and his anti-globalist campaign.Dubya is also likely sore with Trump for winning South Carolina after he pointed out the former president not only failed to prevent 9/11, but also accused the Bush administration of duping the public into supporting the 2003 invasion of Iraq.And Trump also called for the release of the missing 28 pages from 9/11 report, which were classified to protect the Bush family s connections with Saudi Arabia, according to those who have read the pages. That s very serious stuff,  Trump told Fox in April.  It s sort of nice to know who your friends are and perhaps who your enemies are. You re going to see some very revealing things released in those papers. It isn t surprising then that the Bushes won t endorse Trump, but that actually benefits the mogul who sealed the GOP nomination by tapping into the vast, anti-establishment sentiment shared by millions of U.S. voters both inside and outside the Republican Party. People in Washington need to recognize the reason that Trump is winning is because they (his supporters) feel like people in Washington have helped them lose and they re sick of it,  Mike Huckabee pointed out.  That s what this election is largely about, it s an overthrow of the government  we ought to be glad that it is a peaceful revolution with ballots rather than one with bullets.   The donor class runs the political environment in this country and people are waking up to that and they are tired of it. The populist movement was already there before Trump announced his candidacy last June; he simply grew into a wildfire powered by the vast winds of dissatisfied, everyday people.And Trump s crossover support which transcends traditional party lines reveals he has completely transformed U.S. politics forever.Via: InfoWars",politics,"May 7, 2016",0

"Factbox - Battle for Raqqa, Islamic State's Syrian HQ near end","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The battle for the city of Raqqa, which Islamic State had used as its headquarters in Syria, is drawing to an end. Islamic State militants have lost swathes of land to various offensives across Syria and Iraq, forced into a diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley. Their defeat in Raqqa would be a milestone in the fight to roll back the theocratic  caliphate  Islamic State declared in 2014 in both countries. Following are some facts about Raqqa: Raqqa sits on the Euphrates river around 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in north central Syria.  Hardline Sunni militant group Islamic State overran Raqqa in January 2014, seizing control from rebel factions opposed to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States has said Islamic State planned and sent teams from Raqqa to carry out attacks on cities including Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.  THE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.  The United States-led coalition supports the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.  The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians. The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.  Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.  Civilians trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city have endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. Parts of Raqqa that the SDF captured have mostly been cleared of residents.     Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.   The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.  Islamic State has imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule. The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.   The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border. The SDF s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF says it will hand control to once its fighters have defeated Islamic State. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured. The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.  Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border. Besides the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, is also waging its own campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.     A modern-day provincial transport hub and market town, Raqqa was built by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century, serving as its capital at one point. It has been inhabited since antiquity and contains important archaeological and architectural sites. The United Nations has said they have been extensively looted during the war and religious buildings have been damaged. Islamic State militants released a video of them bombing a large part of the Uwais al-Qarani shrine complex in March 2014. ",worldnews,"October 15, 2017 ",1
Images suggest North Korea 'aggressive' work on ballistic missile submarine: institute,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Satellite images taken this month of a North Korean naval shipyard indicate Pyongyang is pursuing an  aggressive schedule  to build its first operational ballistic missile submarine, a U.S. institute reported on Thursday. Washington-based 38 North, a North Korea monitoring project,  cited images taken on Nov. 5 showing activity at North Korea s Sinpo South Shipyard.  The presence of what appear to be sections of a submarine s pressure hull in the yards suggests construction of a new submarine, possibly the SINPO-C ballistic missile submarine - the follow-on to the current SINPO-class experimental ballistic missile submarine,  38 North said in a report. The report said that throughout 2017 there had been continued movement of parts and components into and out of two parts yards adjacent to the constructions halls in the center of the shipyard. It said the Nov. 5 images showed two large circular objects that could be sections of a submarine s pressure hull. It said these appeared larger than those for North Korea s ROMEO-class attack submarine. Images of a test stand indicated continued testing of a  mechanism for ejection launch of missiles from a submarine. However, the report said no activity could be seen suggesting  preparations for a new test of a submarine-launched missile. North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, sparking a major international crisis in which U.S. President Donald Trump has said that all options are under consideration, including military ones. North Korea is also thought to be working on a solid-fuel missile for submarine launches. Last month, The Diplomat magazine quoted a U.S. government source as saying U.S. military intelligence had detected a new diesel-electric submarine under construction at Sinpo and  dubbed it the Sinpo-C. It said the submarine was likely a larger successor to North Korea s single experimental ballistic missile submarine. North Korea has conducted dozens of missile tests this year and its largest and biggest nuclear test on Sept. 3. The past two months have seen a relative lull and it has not tested a missile since firing one over Japan on Sept. 15. Another article in The Diplomat last month quoted a U.S. government source as saying that North Korea had tested a new solid fuel engine sometime between Oct. 15 and Oct. 21. U.S. intelligence officials have declined to comment on this. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Venezuela's chronic shortages give rise to 'medical flea markets',"SAN CRISTOBAL/MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela s critical medicine shortage has spurred  medical flea markets,  where peddlers offer everything from antibiotics to contraceptives laid out among the traditional fruits and vegetables.  The crisis-wrought Latin American nation is heaving under worsening scarcity of drugs, as well as basic foods, due to tanking national production and strict currency controls that crimp imports.  The local pharmaceutical association estimates at any given time, there is a shortage of around 85 percent of drugs. Sick Venezuelans often scour pharmacies and send pleas on social media to find treatment. Increasingly, however, they are turning to a flourishing black market offering medicines surreptitiously bought from Venezuelan hospitals or smuggled in from neighboring Colombia.  Here I can find the vitamins I need for my memory,  said 56-year-old Marisol Salas, who suffered a stroke, as she bought the pills at a small stand at the main bus terminal in the Andean city of San Cristobal.  Around her, Venezuelans asked sellers for medicine to control blood pressure as well as birth control pills.   People are looking for anticonvulsants a lot recently,  said Antuam Lopez, 30, who sells medicine alongside vegetables, and said hospital employees usually provide him with the drugs.  Leftist President Nicolas Maduro says resellers are in league with a U.S.-led conspiracy to sabotage socialism and are to blame for medicine shortages.  In the middle of a market in the humid and sweltering city of Maracaibo, dozens of boxes full of medicines including antibiotics and pain killers are stacked on top of each other. The packaging is visibly deteriorated: The cases are discolored and some are even dirty.  Doctors warn these drugs   usually smuggled in from Colombia, a few hours  drive from Maracaibo   pose risks.   We ve found that a lot of them have not been maintained at proper temperatures,  warned oncologist Jose Oberto, who leads the Zulia state s doctors association.  Still, some Venezuelans feel they have no choice but to rely on contraband medicine.   I had to buy medicine from Colombia, and it worried me  because the label said  hospital use,  said retiree Esledy Paez, 62. But they are often prohibitively expensive for Venezuelans, many of whom earn just a handful of dollars a month at the black market rate due to soaring inflation.  Norkis Pabon struggled to find antibiotics for her hospitalized husband to prevent his foot injury from worsening due to diabetes.   But the treatment costs 900,000 bolivars ($9.43; twice the minimum wage) and I do not know what to do,  said Pabon, who is unemployed.  ",worldnews,"December 8, 2017 ",1
 WATCH: Bill Maher Hilariously Thanks Trump For Exposing Hypocritical Evangelicals,"Bill Maher surprisingly thanked Donald Trump on Friday night for doing at least one good thing during this campaign.For years, conservative  Christians  have said that they want a president who shares their values and morals. But that all went out the window in 2016 when Trump became the Republican nominee.But as we have witnessed, even though Trump definitely has no moral compass and has been nothing but a vulgar bully who incites violence and hate the evangelical community has embraced him anyway.And that made the Real Time host very giddy. Before leaving this election behind, we must all thank Donald Trump for the one good thing he did,  Maher began.  He exposed evangelicals, who are big Trump supporters, as the shameless hypocrites they ve always been. Republicans didn t get to play the Jesus card this time around,  Maher continued.  Because it s hard to bring up the Ten Commandments when your candidate spent his life breaking all of them. Trump s commandments are like the regular commandments with LOL at the end. Maher expressed how good it felt not having religion shoved down our throats throughout this election season as in other elections in the past. And he wondered how so-called  values voters  can still support Trump, a man who literally has committed adultery on several occasions, brags about sexually assaulting women, and lies in every sentence he utters. And as Maher explained, Trump definitely has nothing in common with Jesus. Trump has nothing in common with Jesus, who was from the Middle East. Trump wouldn t even let him in the country. Jesus healed the blind, Trump mocks the handicapped. Jesus turned the other cheek, Trump grabs your pussy. Jesus turned water into wine, Trump just whines. The Bible says,  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s wife.  Trump says,  Fine, what about my daughter? Maher pointed out that evangelicals had a full bench of religious nut jobs to choose from during the primaries, including Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, and Ted Cruz. But they went for the thrice-married foul-mouthed, pussy-grabber,  Maher said before going on to praise the Mormons for not supporting Trump.Here s the video via YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 5, 2016",0
OUCH!

Clinton and her top aide, Huma Abedin, discussed in a July 2011 exchange Clinton s plans to attend the funeral of fellow former First Lady Betty Ford in Grand Rapids, Mich. Looks like plane won t be an issue,  Abedin wrote.  Also, looks like Michelle Obama also going. Is it ok [sic] that we and Mrs. O take two separate planes?  Clinton asked. I think it s ok [sic]. But let me see what kind of plane she s taking,  Abedin responded. I would rather have our own of course,  Clinton added.The new emails surfaced after other messages, ones released during the 2016 presidential campaign, revealed that Clinton and Obama s husband, former President Barack Obama, had an antagonistic relationship. And she HATES that the president ( that man,  as the Clintons call him) kicked her ass in 2008,  Democratic megadonor Jeffrey Leeds wrote to former Secretary of State Colin Powell in March 2015.  She can t believe it or accept it. Leeds also addressed the growing controversy over Clinton s use of a private email server at the State Department, writing that then-President Obama would not care if Clinton found herself in legal trouble. I don t think the president would weep if she found herself in real legal trouble. She ll pummel his legacy if she gets a chance and he knows it,  Leeds said.The exchange between Clinton and Abedin came after another message, one also released during the 2016 election, showed that Clinton complained commercial flights were  burdensome  and asked Abedin to get the Air Force to fly her from Westchester, N.Y. back to Washington, D.C.

China urges North Korea not to go further in a 'dangerous direction',"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China’s foreign minister on Thursday called on North Korea not to go further in a “dangerous direction” with its nuclear program and said negotiations were the only way out of the crisis over Pyongyang’s weapons development. Wang Yi also told the annual U.N. General Assembly China was committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and there should be no new nuclear weapons north or south of the border, or elsewhere in Northeast Asia. He urged the United States to honor its “four ‘no’ commitment,” an apparent reference to an Aug. 1 statement by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in which he said Washington did not seek the collapse or change of the North Korean government, accelerated reunification of the peninsula, or to send its military north of the border. “We urge the DPRK not to go further along a dangerous direction,” Wang said, referring to North Korea by the acronym of its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “And we call upon all parties to play a constructive role in easing tensions. There is still hope for peace and we must not give up. Negotiation is the only way out, which deserves every effort. Parties should meet each other half way, by addressing each other’s legitimate concerns.” Wang made no mention in his speech of U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of new sanctions on Thursday that open the door wider to blacklisting people and entities doing business with North Korea, including its shipping and trade networks. China, North Korea’s main trading partner, has backed successive rounds of United Nations sanctions over North Korean nuclear bomb tests, but has repeatedly said it is opposed to unilateral sanctions and especially “long-arm jurisdiction” over Chinese entities and individuals.

Tennessee bill would allow counselors to deny service based on religion,"(Reuters) - The Tennessee House passed a bill on Wednesday allowing mental health counselors to refuse service to patients on religious grounds, the latest in a list of U.S. state measures that gay rights activists have criticized as discriminating against the LGBT community.  A vote by the state House of Representatives protects therapists and counselors from civil lawsuits and criminal action if they deny services to clients whose religious beliefs conflict with their own. The bill passed by a 68-22 vote and sent to Gov. Bill Haslam for his signature. The state Senate passed the bill earlier this year. Supporters of the bill say it protects the rights of counselors who object on religious grounds to the adopted code of ethics of the American Counseling Association. But opponents say it is an attempt to deny service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, a vulnerable population often in need of counseling services. The House bill, which was sponsored by Republican Rep. Dan Howell, is one of many that are being challenged by human rights organizations claiming the legislation is anti-LGBT. Howell was unavailable for comment Wednesday afternoon. The Tennessee Equality Project, which supports gay rights, condemned the House passage of the bill even though it does not specifically refer to the LGBT issue. The group called on the governor to veto the legislation. Haslam told Nashville Public Radio he has not decided whether to sign or veto the counseling legislation, but he was considering the impact it may have on the state and its citizens. “They (state lawmakers) need to obviously always vote their conscience,” he told the radio station. “One of the things, though, that we should be mindful of is, is there a broader impact?” On Tuesday, PayPal Holdings Inc canceled plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte, North Carolina and invest $3.6 million in the area after the state passed a law requiring people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. Tennessee is considering similar legislation related to school bathrooms, and civil rights groups are watching a Missouri measure seen as discriminatory. Last week, the governors of Georgia and Virginia vetoed “religious liberty” bills. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant on Tuesday signed a far-reaching law allowing people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples and protecting other actions considered discriminatory by gay rights activists.

 Dem Senator ‘Increasingly Concerned’ Trump Will Fire Mueller And Rosenstein To Stop Russia Probe,"Donald Trump is desperate to stop the investigation into his dirty Russian escapades and even went as far as firing FBI Director James Comey, who just happened to be investigating him. Now, Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she is growing  increasingly concerned  that Trump might try to fire both Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the probe into Trump s possible collusion with Russia and his obstruction of justice, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, laid out her concerns in a statement on Friday. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. That s undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the president s oath of office,  she wrote.Citing Trump s most recent tweets regarding the Russia investigation, which he has repeatedly called a  witch hunt,  Feinstein said Trump has  embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light. The Senate should not let that happen. We re a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone, a lesson the president would be wise to learn,  Feinstein said.Trump doesn t have the authority to fire Mueller. However, he can order Rosenstein to fire him. When Rosenstein testified before Congress, he said that he would only consider firing Mueller if there was  good cause.  But if Trump wanted to, he is able to fire Rosenstein and appoint someone who, after Senate confirmation, would follow his orders blindly.But Feinstein warned that this would be a huge mistake on Trump s part and would inevitably lead to a revolt of  even his staunchest supporters. If the president thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, he s in for a rude awakening. Even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law,  she said.The similarities between Trump and Nixon just keep piling up. If he were to go the route Feinstein fears, it would be the Saturday Night Massacre all over again and would probably lead to the same outcome: impeachment.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",0

"Georgia governor orders evacuation of Savannah, coast ahead of Irma","(Reuters) - Georgia Governor Nathan Deal issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for the state s coast, including historic Savannah, as deadly Hurricane Irma rolled toward Florida and the southeastern United States. The evacuation order for areas east of Interstate 95 and some areas to its west takes effect Saturday at 8 a.m., Deal said in a statement. The governor also authorized up to 5,000 Georgia National Guard members to respond to the storm and expanded a state of emergency to 30 southeast Georgia counties. The order affects the cities of Savannah and Brunswick in Georgia, which has not been hit by a Category 3 hurricane or higher since 1898, according to WSB-TV.  I encourage all Georgians in our coastal areas that could be impacted by this storm to evacuate the area as soon as possible,  Deal said in a statement. Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, plowed past the Dominican Republic toward Haiti on Thursday after devastating a string of Caribbean islands and killing at least 10 people. Irma will likely hit Florida as a powerful Category 4 storm on Sunday, with storm surges and flooding beginning within the next 48 hours, according to the NHC. Gas shortages in the  Miami-Fort Lauderdale area worsened on Thursday, with sales up to five times the norm. The storm s exact path is uncertain, but it could affect Georgia and the Carolinas early next week. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1

WATCH: AMAZING THING HAPPENED When H.S. Valedictorian Stepped Up To Podium After ATHEIST Group Told Grads They Could No Longer Recite The Lord’s Prayer,"A 70-year tradition at East Liverpool High School was removed from the graduation ceremony, but students weren t letting it go easily.The Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation, which advocates for separation of church and state, got wind of the school s prayer tradition. They told East Liverpool administrators they needed to stop their choir from singing the Lord s Prayer at graduation.Rather than fighting legal battles, the school removed the song from Sunday s program. But instead of losing part of the ceremony, students decided to lead their own prayer.Graduation at East Liverpool is filled with tradition, and this year students rejected change. I know a lot of my student body was uncomfortable with it, just because it is tradition to have prayer at our school,  said Cami Post, class of 2016 vice president. The idea of one person or 2 or 3 standing up and saying they don t want prayer back in school or even singing or reciting is sad,  said Pastor Rodney Ohler, Salineville Assembly of God.Ohler and members of his church stood outside to support keeping the prayer in school.

Trump says Israel should be 'reasonable' in peace process,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called on “Israel to be reasonable with respect to peace”, spelling out in his own words his administration’s stance that new settlements on Palestinian land may not be helpful in an interview with an Israeli newspaper.  Trump’s comments to Israel Today come as he tones down his pro-Israel bravado ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trip to the White House on Feb. 15. “I want Israel to be reasonable with respect to peace. I want to see peace happen,” Trump said in the interview published on Friday. “I would like to see a level of reasonableness of both parties, and I think we have a good chance of doing that.”  During his 2016 election campaign, Trump signaled his presidency would be a boon for Israel and tough on Palestinians. He talked of moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, naming an ambassador who backs Israel’s settlement program and exerting no pressure on Israel for peace talks. Now Trump is adopting a more measured stance. Even though the White House did not join the widespread criticism this week of a new Israeli law which retroactively legalizes about 4,000 existing settler homes, its pro-Israel approach shows signs of being more nuanced.  “They [settlements] don’t help the process. I can say that,” Trump told the Israeli daily owned by U.S. casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, a Netanyahu supporter and Republican Party donor. “Every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left,” Trump said. “I am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace.” The president said his administration was “looking at some other options” regarding the settlements.       He also said he was still studying the case for relocating the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, a move that could anger the Arab world.  “The embassy is not an easy decision. It has obviously been out there for many, many years, and nobody has wanted to make that decision. I’m thinking about it very seriously, and we will see what happens,” Trump said.

"Czech parliament picks speaker, opens way for new prime minister","PRAGUE (Reuters) - The newly-elected Czech lower house of parliament on Wednesday picked a speaker from the biggest party ANO, a source in the voting committee said, opening the way for the government to resign and ANO chief Andrej Babis to become prime minister. Babis, whose ANO party won the October election by a large margin on pledges to uproot corruption and streamline functioning of the state, has been asked by President Milos Zeman to form a government but has so far failed to find majority support.

 Report: Corrupt Wall Streeters Are Three Times More Likely To Go Unpunished Under Trump,"Donald Trump s chief economic adviser and Director of the National Economic Council is Gary Cohn. Trump s Secretary of the Treasury is Steven Mnuchin. Dina Powell is his Deputy National Security Adviser, and Steve Bannon is the president s chief strategist. What do all of these people have in common, aside from terrible taste in employers?They all came from Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street powerhouse that made billions of dollars during the subprime mortgage crisis that tanked the American economy beginning in 2007.Much has been made of the hypocrisy of Donald Trump s claims of  draining the swamp.  He simultaneously hired and promoted many of the same (and some even worse) swamp-dwellers that made Washington, D.C. into the quagmire of grift, corruption, and greed that constituted the bog that needed its plug pulled. But all we knew until now was that those assholes were still in positions of authority. We had no idea what kind of impact they were having on Trump s presidency, outside of tax proposals that screw ordinary Americans and drastically reduce rates for people like themselves.But now an analysis from the Wall Street Journal is shedding some light on a more nefarious aspect of their influence on Trump policy:Wall Street regulators have imposed far lower penalties in the first six months of Donald Trump s presidency than they did during the first six months of 2016, a comparable period in the Obama administration.If you re like me, you know that Wall Street isn t suddenly behaving itself   so why the change?It comes from another of Trump s campaign promises: To destroy Dodd-Frank, the now 7 year-old bill signed by Barack Obama that aimed to  reform  Wall Street after the fallout from the massive recession they were essentially solely responsible for. Life savings were lost, the housing market was upended, and ultimately the US economy tanked, resulting in bailouts for the big banks that both parties hated. Back on April 11, Trump met with a bunch of CEOs and told them they didn t have to worry much longer:For the bankers in the room, they ll be very happy because we re really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else.But Trump s drive to dismantle the landmark legislation still hasn t taken effect, so in the meantime, what his administration can do to make life easier for Wall Street   literally the only people who will benefit from the destruction of Dodd-Frank   is to back off the penalty part of the  horrendous  regulations Dodd-Frank imposed. And boy, have they. From the WSJ:Penalties levied against firms and individuals by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in the first half of 2017 were down nearly two-thirds compared with the first half of 2016.

Trump on Obamacare repeal: from boasts of greatness to lessons learned,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday was dealt his biggest blow since taking office just over two months ago when House Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system.  Throughout his presidential campaign and since taking office, Trump had repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Below are a sampling of tweets that Trump posted in March on his plans to repeal Obamacare, followed by comments from Trump on Friday after his fellow Republicans yanked the plan. Tweets on vow to repeal and replace Obamacare: March 7: “Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!”  March 9: “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” March 13: “ObamaCare is imploding. It is a disaster and 2017 will be the worst year yet, by far! Republicans will come together and save the day.” March 16: “Great progress on healthcare. Improvements being made - Republicans coming together!”  March 24: “After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums & deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!” Trump comments on Friday after the bill was pulled:  “We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process.” “Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we’ll end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes.” “We really had it. It was pretty much there, within grasp.” “We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and the House.” ",politicsNews,"March 25, 2017 ",1
Russian Islamic State fighter sentenced to hang in Iraq,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A Russian Islamic State fighter was sentenced to death by hanging in Iraq on Tuesday, authorities said, a rare conviction of a foreign militant on terrorism charges. The unnamed man was captured after running out of ammunition in western Mosul, a spokesman for Iraq s Supreme Judicial Council said in a statement.  The Russian was a member of Daesh operating in Mosul since 2015,  he added, using an Arabic acronym for the Sunni Muslim militant group.  Thousands of foreigners have been fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.   Security and aid officials told Reuters over the weekend that Iraqi authorities were holding 1,400 foreign wives and children of suspected militants - most from Turkey, others from former Soviet states including Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Russia. Iraqi forces, backed by U.S.-led coalition allies and Kurds, retook Mosul in July following the group s occupation of the country s second largest city in 2014. The Sunni militant group still controls territory in Iraq and is expected to revert to more conventional insurgent tactics such as bombings as its self-proclaimed caliphate falls apart.

 Women Will Get More Elected Representation If Clinton Becomes President,"In 1991, when old, white men turned on Anita Hill, a monster was awakened, and that monster was the fury of the woman. In the 1992 election, women let the old boy s club know exactly how it felt   they elected a Democrat for president, and they made unprecedented gains in the House and he Senate. The 1992 election was called the Year of the Woman. And it was all thanks to one woman   Hill   who stood up to the good old boys.And now that the 2016 Democratic Primary is almost over, with Hillary Clinton reaching the threshold to claim victory, women will come out of the woodwork (at an even faster pace) and enact real change.Vox contends that should Clinton win the presidency, just her mere presence in the White House will be enough to spur a growth of women running for office:Clinton s gender is the most obvious way she stands out from everyone who s held the presidency before, but people inside and outside the campaign have hesitated to argue explicitly that it matters. But it does matter. Enormously. A woman president would be   by far   the biggest, most salient, and most important example of a successful woman in American politics likely inspiring secondary and tertiary waves of women s election runs and election victories.Using analysis from political consultant Amelia Showalter, Vox shows that when women are even mentioned as potentially running for office, female involvement in the whole process increases by a percentage point. When a woman is elected as a state Attorney General, participation increases to two percent. When elected Governor, it increases to 2.36 percent. When elected Senator, it increases to 2.9 percent.Should Clinton be elected President of the United States, with the sort of name recognition she has, the amount of female participation in the process (elected and unelected) would increase astronomically. And that measure doesn t include the throngs of women Clinton will choose to fill her cabinet.Analysis also shows that when women have representation (such as the presidency) and their identity politics   abortion, equal pay, childcare   are adequately represented by women, they will cause a ripple effect that will essentially bring male legislators onto their side. As Tali Mendelberg, Christopher Karpowitz, and Nicholas Goedert show:When women are many, they are more likely to voice women s distinctive concerns about children, family, the poor and the needy. What s more, when women are more numerous and therefore more vocal on these topics, men become more vocal too, and these effects are associated with more generosity to the poor.Women, in a sense, could liberalize the country by being elected to office. How do they get elected to office? They are inspired to run. And how are they inspired to run? They see other women, like Hillary Clinton, achieve high office.It s a ripple effect that will usher in the much needed change in Washington. After all, it s been proven that women in Congress, when they are in charge, get more done in a more bipartisan fashion.Hillary Clinton is going to help continue that.Featured image via Kevin Winter",News,"June 7, 2016",0
Australian PM future safeguarded in crucial Sydney by-election,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s conservative coalition government regained its razor-thin parliamentary majority on Saturday after inner Sydney voters re-elected a former professional tennis player in a special poll triggered by a constitutional crisis. The Liberal Party victory in the blue-ribbon Sydney seat of Bennelong is a much-needed relief for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose leadership has been increasingly unpopular with the public over the past two years. A loss in Bennelong would have plunged his government into a parliamentary minority, forcing it to rely on independent lawmakers to complete its agenda. A loss would also have placed Turnbull s personal position in danger. With around 73 percent of the two-party preferred vote counted by late Saturday, the opposition Labor Party candidate Kristina Keneally has secured a swing of about 5.6 percent against the Liberal Party s John Alexander, according to the Australian Electoral Commission. While a sizeable swing, that was well short of the 10 percent plus needed to install Keneally, a high-profile former premier of New South Wales, Australia s most populous state, in federal politics, and the Labor Party conceded defeat. The battle for Bennelong was bitterly fought. Turnbull  campaigned personally for Alexander in the electorate both in the run-up to the vote and on the day of the poll.  Thank you Bennelong, the people of Bennelong have put their faith in this man,  Turnbull told cheering supporters as he raised Alexander s arm in a victory celebration.  Liberals have come from across the state, across the nation.  But Keneally, who ran a robust campaign urging voters to use the by-election to punish the federal government, warned Turnbull that he should be concerned about the swing to Labor.  The verdict is in, the message is clear, we have had enough of your lousy leadership,  she said in her concession speech.   Malcolm Turnbull injected himself in this campaign, he owns this result.  Turnbull s coalition has been forced to govern in minority since October, when a citizenship crisis cost him several cabinet members and wiped out his flimsy majority. Among those forced out was Turnbull s deputy, Barnaby Joyce, who has since won back his seat. Turnbull, who has lagged in opinion polls all year, and his minority government were forced to accept a widespread banking inquiry after independent members in parliament flexed their new-found power. The race tightened in recent days amid a diplomatic spat between Australia and China, sparked when Turnbull accused Beijing of improper interference in Canberra. One in five Bennelong voters has Chinese heritage, raising fears of a backlash. Alexander was forced to re-contest his seat after becoming one of 10 lawmakers, alongside Joyce, to leave parliament in recent months as they were swept up in the citizenship crisis. Alexander left parliament because he believed he might hold dual British citizenship, which he has since rescinded. Australia s constitution bars foreign nationals from sitting in parliament to prevent split allegiances. ",worldnews,"December 16, 2017 ",1
Treasury's Mnuchin to 'push hard' for U.S. interests at G20: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be “pushing hard” to advance U.S. interests in his debut meeting with Group of 20 counterparts this week, including reaffirming commitments to avoid competitive currency devaluations, a senior Treasury official said on Monday.Mnuchin, who will attend a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 major economies on Friday and Saturday in Baden-Baden, Germany, also will press countries to help strengthen global growth, the official told reporters. “The G20 can play a helpful role in advancing U.S. interests. The secretary will be pushing hard to make that come to pass, whether it’s on macroeconomic policies, exchange rate policies etcetera,” the official said. The official said it was important to the Trump administration that previous G20 commitments to not target exchange rates to gain a competitive trade advantage be reaffirmed and fully implemented.  But that explicit pledge, which has long been a part of past G20 communiques, was not included in an early draft of the statement to be issued at the Baden-Baden meeting. The early draft, which is subject to more revisions, simply stated “we reaffirm our previous exchange-rate commitments.” The early draft also dropped language to “resist all forms of protectionism” in favor of a pledge to “maintain an open and fair international trading system.” The U.S. Treasury official declined to discuss the language that would be in the final communique but said that the Trump administration was committed to “fair and open trade.” “I think that means a trading system that has a level playing field for our firms and our workers globally, and we’ll be encouraging policies that lead to that level playing field so that our firms and workers are not disadvantaged,” the official said. Trump officials have criticized China on a host of trade-related fronts related to its $347 billion trade surplus with the United States last year. These include President Donald Trump’s own charges that Beijing manipulates its yuan currency and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ complaints about Chinese excess industrial capacity, unfair subsidies for state-owned enterprises and a lack of access for foreign firms to major sectors of China’s economy. The U.S. Treasury said in October that none of the U.S.’ major trading partners was manipulating its currency to gain advantage for its exports. Mnuchin has said he would not pass judgment on China’s currency practices until Treasury issues its semi-annual currency report in mid-April.    China has announced plans to reduce some capacity in its steel industry in recent months and has urged the United States to move cautiously in pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases. The country’s ministry of commerce has denied U.S. charges that China’s aluminum industry is receiving unfair subsidies.  Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro last week also said Washington needed bilateral engagement with Germany to reduce its $65 billion trade surplus with the United States. The Treasury official said that countries with a trade surplus have a role to play in helping to achieve the G20’s goals of maintaining “strong, sustainable and balanced growth.”   ",politicsNews,"March 13, 2017 ",1
Saudis pledge $100 million to African anti-jihadist force: Mali,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has pledged $100 million to a new regional military force battling jihadist groups in West Africa s Sahel region, force member Mali said on Monday.  The contribution would be a major boost to the cash-strapped force and bring pledged commitments to more than half the roughly $500 million the G5 Sahel says it needs for its first year of operations.   The G5 Sahel - composed of the armies of Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad - launched its first military campaign in October amid growing unrest in the Sahel, whose porous borders are regularly crossed by jihadists, including affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State. Those groups have stepped up attacks on civilian and military targets, including tourist attractions in regional capitals, raising fears the zone will become a new breeding ground for militants.   Mali s foreign ministry said Saudi Arabian authorities made the pledge during a visit to the kingdom late last month by Malian Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Diop.

Philippine leader changes his tune with praise for U.S. 'allies',"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte voiced rare praise for the United States on Thursday, calling it an important security ally, and dismissing historic grievances and his slew of past tirades against Washington as  water under the bridge . Duterte s anti-American outbursts have become notorious and baffling for one of Washington s closest Asian allies since the nation gained independence from the United States in 1946. He was speaking on the 116th anniversary of one of the bloodiest battles in the American-Philippines war on the central island of Samar, where 39 Filipino civilians were killed in retaliation for the deaths of 48 soldiers killed by rebels. Last year, at his first international summit in Laos, the maverick leader stunned regional leaders when he showed them pictures of that massacre. Then U.S. President Barack Obama canceled a bilateral meeting there with Duterte, who had called him a  son of a bitch  days earlier for expressing concern about his bloody war on drugs. On Thursday, Duterte said he had been advised to tone down his anti-American rhetoric and had positive words for the U.S. military, with which he has repeatedly threatened to sever ties, besides accusing it of supplying ineffective combat hardware and of making the Philippines a potential target for war.  This is all water under the bridge, I was under advice by the Department of Foreign Affairs, that I would temper my language and avoid cursing, which I am prone to do if I get emotional,  Duterte said in a speech.  I would not say they were our saviours, but they are our allies and they helped us. Even today, they provide crucial equipment to our soldiers in Marawi to fight the terrorists,  he said, referring to a city where Islamic State loyalists have been holed up for four months. Duterte was speaking in Balangiga, a town burned down in 1901 by U.S. soldiers, who seized two church bells as war trophies. Duterte has demanded the return of the bells and the two countries are now discussing the terms. Since Donald Trump replaced Obama as president, Duterte s attacks on the United States have decreased, though he vowed never to go there and last week passed up the opportunity to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Duterte sprang a surprise last month with a warm reception for visiting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, describing himself as a  humble friend  of the United States.  Some commentators have attributed his softer tone to the Trump administration refraining from criticism of Duterte s signature war on drugs. Duterte s foreign minister Alan Peter Cayetano, who met Tillerson in Washington on Wednesday, said the Philippines was open to receiving foreign observers to examine its human rights record and war on drugs, which has killed thousands.  We made it clear that we have nothing to hide and are ready to work with experts or observers as long as they are independent and fair,  Cayetano said in a statement.

" FBI MEMO CONFIRMS: Trump Told Comey To End Russia Probe, Attack Press In The Most ABHORRENT Way","Trump has been bested by a man who is far smarter and far more ethical than he could ever dream of. James Comey apparently documented his conversations with Trump in memos, and the New York Times has spoken to at least two people who reportedly have those memos and read parts of it to them. In one memo, which documents a conversation that happened back in February, Comey reports that Trump said: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. This conversation reportedly took place the day after Flynn resigned, so we can assume that Trump thought, or hoped, that he could force that to be the end of it. The White House has already made it clear that they re going to try and pin this whole mess on Flynn and claim ignorance, and a conversation like this, with Trump asking Comey to drop it, fits in with that narrative rather well.But that s not all. That memo also reportedly says that Trump told Comey to consider jailing members of the press who publish classified leaks. Trump believes that the leaks coming from the White House are the bigger threat and has been raging for weeks that the FBI hasn t been focusing on those.In other words, Trump was not only trying to turn all eyes off of him, he wanted Comey to start working on his  jail all press who speak negatively of me  plan.Comey was known for taking detailed notes, particularly when he felt that the details of a conversation might be questioned later on. The Times reports that he created memos about every meeting and phone call he and Trump, and he did share some of them with senior FBI officials.Of course, the White House is fervently denying this conversation happened this way. According to the Times piece, their official statement on the matter says: While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey. Of course it s not, at least, not to the White House. Trump has said that this investigation is a hoax perpetrated by the Democrats in his desperation to appear totally innocent. He even had a law firm send a certified letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham that was somehow supposed to prove that neither he, nor his associates, colluded with Russia at any time.Trump never succeeded in getting Comey to do what he wanted in anything. He never got Comey to shift his attention to leaks of classified info and jailing members of the press who published them, and he never got Comey to stop investigating his own, and his campaign s, ties to Russia. He s now so desperate that he s sending out fundraising emails begging his supporters to help him win against the  deep state. No wonder Comey was fired. Expect the White House to spin up a brand-new web of lies, which may include more threats against Comey and other FBI officials.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017",0

Exclusive: South Sudan's government using food as weapon of war - U.N. report,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - South Sudan President Salva Kiir s government is using food as a weapon of war to target civilians by blocking life-saving aid in some areas, United Nations sanctions monitors told the Security Council in a confidential report seen by Reuters on Friday. During 2016 and 2017, the U.N. monitors said a military campaign by government troops in the northwestern town of Wau and surrounding areas in Western Bahr el-Ghazal targeted civilians on ethnic grounds and displaced more than 100,000.  The government has during much of 2017 deliberately prevented life-saving food assistance from reaching some citizens,  the monitors wrote.  These actions amount to using food as a weapon of war with the intent to inflict suffering on civilians the government views as opponents to its agenda.    The denial of aid had caused extreme food insecurity among large sections of the population, with malnutrition and death by starvation the documented outcome, in particular in the Greater Baggari area in Wau County,  they said in the report submitted to the U.N. Security Council s South Sudan sanctions committee. South Sudan s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report.  South Sudan spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, and a third of the 12 million population has fled their homes. The conflict was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer, who is being held in South Africa. The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan was providing  fertile ground  for a genocide. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited the Juba late last month, where she told Kiir that the United States had lost trust in his government and risked losing Washington s support if he did not pursue peace. The U.N. monitors reported that the government had regularly denied humanitarian aid access to certain parts of the population, in particular areas outside the town of Wau, which was visited by U.N. Security Council ambassadors in September last year.  One of those areas, Greater Baggari, is noteworthy for the persistent and systematic nature of the government s access denials, and the catastrophic humanitarian conditions that have resulted,  the independent U.N. monitors said. In August, the government eased restrictions, allowing aid groups to distribute food and lifesaving assistance to more than 12,000 people in Greater Baggari. Villages had been looted and burned and crops destroyed, the U.N. monitors wrote.   One humanitarian assessment mission told the U.N. monitors that 164 young children and elderly had died from hunger and disease between January and September 2017. The report by the U.N. monitors found that despite the catastrophic conditions across South Sudan, armed forces, groups and militias - particularly those affiliated with Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai - continued to  actively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.  U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed in South Sudan since 2011. An East African bloc, IGAD, led two rounds of peace talks over two years, culminating in a brief power-sharing agreement signed by Kiir and Machar in 2015. But even as IGAD urges a new ceasefire, the warring parties are preparing for more fighting.  The coming dry season in South Sudan will, absent a change in the current conflict dynamics, see further fighting and civilian suffering as the government continues to pursue military victory over political compromise,  the U.N. monitors wrote.

USDA disavows gag-order emailed to scientific research unit,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday that an internal email sent to staff at its Agricultural Research Service unit this week calling for a suspension of “public-facing documents,” including news releases and photos, was flawed and that new guidance has been sent out to replace it. The ARS focuses on scientific research into the main issues facing agriculture, including long-term climate change. President Donald Trump has cast doubt on whether man-made climate change is real and has railed against ex-President Barack Obama’s efforts to combat it. “This internal email was released without Departmental direction, and prior to Departmental guidance being issued,” USDA said in a statement. “ARS will be providing updated direction to its staff.” It said peer-reviewed scientific papers from the unit should not be blocked. “ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public.” The original email, sent Jan. 23, said: “Starting immediately and until further notice, ARS will not release any public-facing documents. This includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds, and social media content.” USDA officials said that after the email was sent, acting USDA Deputy Secretary Michael L. Young sent out a three-page memo to USDA agency department heads and other key agency officials outlining the interim procedures staff should follow. A copy of the interim procedures memo, dated Jan. 23 and seen by Reuters, shows many of the steps reflect either the same or similar measures taken by the previous administration. Reuters also saw a memo, dated Jan. 22, 2009, that was sent to agency officials by former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. The 2017 memo, however, differs in two main areas.  It centralizes the agency’s media inquiries and social media presence through the Office of the Secretary. As part of that, the memo asks USDA agencies to “review their websites, blog posts and other social media and, consistent with direction you will receive from the Office of Communication, remove references to policy priorities and initiatives of the previous Administration.” It also rescinds the ability of USDA agencies to close an office or notify local delegations of office closures.

Trump visit to Britain still unfixed nine months after PM May's invitation: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nine months after Prime Minister Theresa May invited President Donald Trump for a formal state visit to Britain, no arrangements have yet been made and there is no sign of the visit taking place soon, U.S. and British officials said. Discussions between Washington and London about a Trump visit have continued, said one official who asked not to be named, but so far the White House has not signaled when and how the president wants to proceed. May s invitation to Trump during a visit to Washington a few days after he took office sparked controversy in Britain. Just hours after she left the White House, Trump announced his widely-criticized ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries. Such is the controversy that some officials on both sides of the Atlantic are privately having second thoughts about the visit, worried about street demonstrations that might greet Trump in London and other British cities.  There have been signs of relief in some quarters that he has yet to appear on Her Majesty s schedule,  said a British official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Given Trump s penchant for showmanship and his pre-presidential visits to the two golf courses he owns in Scotland, many Trump-watchers expected Britain to be one of the first stops on any presidential European tour. White House representatives told British officials at the time of the invite that Trump had accepted. But a senior U.S. government official told Reuters in July that Trump had no plans to visit Britain in the near future. A full-scale state visit to Britain involves considerable pomp. Upon arriving in London, the president would be greeted by Queen Elizabeth and other members of the Royal Family at a ceremony near the Houses of Parliament.  Some British opponents of Trump including former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband have promised to organize protests should he visit.  We remain in the same position with the Trump visit   The queen extended an invitation to President Trump to visit the UK, it was accepted, and there is no change to those plans. But a date has not been set,  a spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington said.  We re looking forward to welcoming President Trump to the UK,  the spokesman added. U.S. officials, including Trump aides and spokespeople and representatives of the U.S. Embassy in London, did not respond to detailed emails requesting comment. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1

Last year, Golf Digest ranked it the 43rd best course in California.In a statement sent to The Washington Post, the group said the vandalism was carried out in response to the Trump administration s  blatant disregard  for the environment: Tearing up the golf course felt justified in many ways,  the member said.  Repurposing what was once a beautiful stretch of land into a playground for the privileged is an environmental crime in its own right.

Dutch tourist group cuts South Africa visit short after armed bus robbery,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A group of 36 Dutch tourists were flying out of South Africa on Tuesday after they were robbed at gunpoint on Sunday in a brazen heist while traveling from Johannesburg s main international airport to their hotel, officials said. The incident is an embarrassment for South Africa, a country keen to promote itself as a tourist destination but scarred by violent crime. Tourism accounts for 3 percent of GDP and is seen as a bright spot in an otherwise moribund economy. Journalists saw the group pull out of the hotel in a bus under police escort after they met with South Africa s police minister and tourist minister as well the ambassador from the Netherlands.  We ll bring these criminals to book. We ll find them,  Police Minister Fikile Mbalula told journalists after the meeting. The bus was stopped on Sunday night by a vehicle with police markings and one man in police uniform with five accomplices in civilian clothing robbed the tourists at gunpoint. Nobody was shot but two people were injured, police said. Dutch ambassador Marisa Gerards said most of the tourists had to cut their visit short because all of their belongings were taken.   Ironically, she said many of the tourists had  booked this organized trip out of safety concerns.   South Africa entices tourists with first-rate infrastructure, sunshine, beaches, wildlife and an exchange rate that makes its food and wine cheap by global standards.  But a jobless rate of over 25 percent and glaring income disparities have worsened its problems with violent crime. The murder rate is 34 per 100,000 people, according to data released by police last year, almost seven times the rate in the United States. ",worldnews,"September 26, 2017 ",1
Justice Department appeals judge's immigration order,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department filed an appeal late Saturday to restore President Donald Trump’s immigration order barring citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees, even as travelers raced to enter the country while the ban was lifted. The government moved to reverse a federal judge’s Friday order that lifted the travel ban and warned the decision posed an immediate harm to the public, thwarted enforcement of an executive order and “second-guesses the president’s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of (non-citizens) and the best means of minimizing that risk.”  Friday’s ruling prompted Trump to denounce the “so-called” judge in a series of tweets on Saturday..  The appeal now goes to a three-judge panel which can act at anytime to uphold the order or suspend it pending a full appeal. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. A ruling could come at any time. Seattle U.S. District Judge James Robart’s decision barred the administration from enforcing the sweeping order that also indefinitely barred Syrian refugee admissions and prompted large protests across the United States.  Trump, whose personal attack on Robart, decrying his opinion as “ridiculous,” went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the White House and Congress, said he was confident the government would prevail. “We’ll win. For the safety of the country, we’ll win,” he told reporters in Florida. Robart’s ruling came in a case brought by the state attorney general of Washington state and was backed by major state employers Amazon.com Inc and Expedia Inc.. The lawsuit is one of several now filed against the Trump executive order around the United States, but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide. The Justice Department appeal criticized Robart’s legal reasoning, saying it violates the separation of powers and steps on the president’s authority as commander chief. The appeal said the state of Washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order “favors Christians at the expense of Muslims.” Congress gave the president “the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class” of visitor, the Justice Department wrote. “Courts are particularly ill-equipped to second-guess the president’s prospective judgment about future risks,” the appeal said, calling the decision “vastly overbroad.” Washington state lawyers worked around the clock last weekend against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at U.S. airports, where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president’s directive. A spokesman for Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson didn’t immediately comment early Sunday. The U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security said they were complying with Robart’s order and many visitors are expected to start arriving on Sunday, while the government said it expects to begin admitting refugees again on Monday. A decision to reinstate Trump’s order could again cause havoc at U.S. airports because some visitors are in transit, as was the case when the order took effect on Jan. 27. As the ban lifted Friday, refugees and thousands of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by the  executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the United States. The panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes three judges appointed by former Republican president George W. Bush and two former Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama. U.S. immigration advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union on Saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations “to consider rebooking travel to the United States immediately” because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold. A U.S. State Department email reviewed by Reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including Syrians as soon as Monday. Trump’s Jan. 27 order had barred admission of citizens from seven majority Muslim nations for 90 days, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees.  It is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the U.S. Constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and Congress. Reached by email Saturday, Robart declined comment on Trump’s tweets. Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement Saturday that Trump’s “hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous. He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.” In an interview with ABC scheduled to air Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence said he did not think that Trump’s criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers. The court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to Trump’s push to clamp down on immigration. The sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would-be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the United States will remain open. In Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Fuad Sharef and his family prepared to fly on Saturday to Istanbul and then New York before starting a new life in Nashville, Tennessee. Virtually all refugees also were barred by Trump’s order, upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the United States. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2017 ",1
U.S. 'disappointed' by India's visa refusal for religious rights panel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department was “disappointed” India had refused visas to members of a U.S. commission that examines violations of religious freedom around the world, a spokesman said on Monday. The commission, made up mainly of professors and leaders of non-profit groups appointed by the president and members of Congress, had planned to travel to India last week but New Delhi failed to issue them visas. The Indian Embassy said in a statement on its web site that “a foreign entity” like the U.S. commission had no standing to pass judgment on the state of India’s constitutionally protected rights. Robert George, a professor of jurisprudence at Princeton who chairs the commission, said last week it was unfortunate that a secular democracy like India had refused a visit from the panel, which has been permitted in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and China, which restrict religious freedoms. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the United States was “disappointed by this news.” “We’re supportive of the commission and the important role they play in reviewing facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom around the world,” Kirby said. He declined to say whether the State Department had discussed the issue with counterparts in New Delhi. But he did say the United States remained engaged “in a number of discussions” with the government on the issue. The commission said in its 2015 report on religious freedom that incidents of religiously motivated and communal violence had reportedly increased for three consecutive years. It said that despite India’s status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, New Delhi had long struggled to protect minority religious communities or provide justice when crimes occurred, creating a climate of impunity. Non-governmental organizations and religious leaders, including from the Muslim, Christian, and Sikh communities, attributed the initial increase in violence to religiously divisive campaigning in the 2014 general election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, which won the vote. Since the election, religious minorities have been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked the BJP and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by Hindu nationalist groups. Despite a much-heralded fresh start in U.S.-India relations under Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the BJP, the United States has run into problems arranging visits by other American officials, including the head of its office to combat human trafficking and its special envoy for gay rights.

Trump to sign executive order Tuesday on infrastructure projects,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday “establishing discipline and accountability in the environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects,” the White House said in a statement on Monday. Trump, who is visiting his residence at Trump Tower in New York City, will also participate in a discussion on infrastructure and give a statement on the subject at 3:45 p.m. (1945 GMT). The White House did not give additional details on the executive order. Trump, who was a real estate developer before becoming president, made rebuilding the country’s crumbling infrastructure a top campaign issue. He has proposed leveraging $200 billion in government spending into $1 trillion of projects to privatize the air traffic control system, strengthen rural infrastructure and repair bridges, roads and waterways. In June, Trump said one of the biggest obstacles to new infrastructure projects was “the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build.” ",politicsNews,"August 15, 2017 ",1
Factbox: Catalonia crisis - What's next?,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain on Friday sacked Catalonia s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21, in a bid to draw a line under the country s worst political crisis in 40 years. Below are several scenarios of what could happen in the next few days. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia s government including regional president Carles Puigdemont and his deputy Oriol Junqueras and assumed direct control over the region. Central government ministries will assume directly the powers of the Catalan administration until a regional election takes place on Dec. 21. It is not clear whether a snap regional election will resolve the crisis. An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government. Other opinion polls have shown Catalonia is almost evenly split between pro- and anti-independence supporters. Catalonia s main secessionist groups have called for widespread civil disobedience. They also instructed civil servants not to obey orders from Madrid and respond with peaceful resistance. It is unclear whether such calls will be followed or not. Spain s government said it was not planning to make any arrests, but it is unclear how it will proceed if the current regional administration staff refuse to leave their offices. A growing number of analysts fear this could lead to a physical confrontation if national police, who used heavy-handed tactics to thwart an Oct. 1 vote on independence, seek to intervene. One of the main problems over the implementation of direct rule will relate to Catalonia s own police forces, the Mossos d Esquadra. Rajoy said the Mossos chief would be fired. But a group of Mossos favoring independence has already said they would not follow instructions from the central government and would not use force to remove ministers and lawmakers from power. Several officers told Reuters they believed the 17,000-strong force was split between those who want independence and those who oppose it. The Mossos, whose chief is under investigation on suspicion of sedition, will have to act on direct orders from their new bosses. If deemed necessary, Mossos officers may be replaced by national police. The Economy Ministry has already increased its control over regional finances, to block the use of state funds to organize the secession bid, and started paying directly for essential services. Under the new proposal, Madrid will take full financial control. Many companies have however said on condition of anonymity that they feared a new Catalan treasury could start levying taxes, and that they would seek to move their tax base outside Catalonia. It is also possible that some pro-independence Catalans will stop paying their taxes to the Spanish treasury. The Spanish government had initially said it would control widely watched Catalan public television TV3, but it eventually dropped that plan. The media is likely to play an important role in the run-up to the new election in Catalonia. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
 WATCH Veteran Rip Trump A New One: I Defended This Country Alongside The People You Hate,"It s not just white American men who fight and die for this country. Women, Muslims, and Hispanics have as well and this military veteran wants Donald Trump to know it.During a protest against the Republican nominee in New York, U.S. Army veteran Perry O Brien declared that he proudly put on the uniform and defended the nation against terrorists in Afghanistan alongside women, Muslim, and Hispanic soldiers who also wore the uniform donning the red, white, and blue American flag patch. When I served in Afghanistan I served with women, I served with Muslims, and I served with Latinos   all groups that Donald Trump has maligned or even threatened,  O Brien said.  All of those folks actually donned the uniform. They actually served the country. As far as we can see as veterans in the military community, Donald Trump only seems interested in serving himself. Indeed, Donald Trump has never fought for this country. In fact, he repeatedly dodged the draft during the Vietnam War through a series of deferments. And even though he was too cowardly to serve his country during wartime, Trump has repeatedly disrespected Vietnam War veterans ever since.In 1997, Trump infamously referred to his sleeping around with various women his  personal Vietnam  because he didn t get an STD. I ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world. It is a dangerous world out there. It s scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam-era,  Trump said.  It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier. And last year, Trump insulted Senator John McCain by questioning his war hero status because he was captured by the enemy and tortured relentlessly to the point where McCain can no longer lift his arms over his head.  He s not a war hero,  Trump claimed.  He s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren t captured, OK? Trump has also repeatedly insulted women, referred to Mexicans as rapists, and called for banning Muslims from the country from the first day of his campaign.So it s no wonder why veterans like Perry O Brien are pissed off about the possibility of Trump becoming commander-in-chief.O Brien even slammed Trump for not donating money to veterans organizations before running for president because it looks like he is only doing it to improve his image right now. I think we all believe in the veterans community that it would be fantastic if Trump had decided he was interested in donating any of his vast wealth   which he loves to talk about so much   to veterans organizations in any substantive way before he decided he wanted to be the next commander-in-chief. Here s the video via YouTube.A Trump presidency also makes it more likely that more American soldiers will come home as wounded vets or in flag-draped caskets since ole small hands himself has suggested the possibility of waging nuclear war along with waging wars against other nations that would definitely require ground troops.Donald Trump is not the presidential candidate our veterans deserve. They need a president who will do everything possible to avoid war and they need a president who will make sure they and their families are well taken care of if war is necessary.Featured image via screenshot",News,"June 2, 2016",0
 You Will Not BELIEVE What Conservatives Actually Think About Scalia’s Death (SCREENSHOTS/VIDEO),"As soon as news broke of notorious hatemonger Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death, some liberals joked that conservatives are so desperate to hate Obama that they would accuse the president of murder. The idea seemed so nonsensical that it could never happen. Sure, it was entirely expected that Republicans would immediately vow to block any Obama nominees no matter who they are. Republicans have been working to stand in between Obama and success since before he was elected the first time. But to accuse him of murdering Scalia?Scalia, a man who opposed anything that advanced human rights at every turn, was a 79-year-old obese gentleman who smoked (factors that greatly contribute to one s risk of death), but lived a full life   one he chose to waste opposing LGBT rights, a woman s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, racial equality, and other endeavors rational, thinking, decent human beings would consider reasonable.That President Obama will be nominating a replacement is something that frightens conservatives   apparently to the point that the gerbils that operate their brains have all simultaneously died. All across right-wing social media, you can find a curious assertion repeated: that bastard Obama gone done and killed Scalia. On Twitter, several hashtags have formed to push the moronic belief that the President s secret Muslim enforcers gave Scalia a heart attack   and there is such an outpouring of stupid, Sarah Palin will likely announce plans to speak about foreign policy for 30 minutes straight in order to regain her title as the Dumbest F*cking Human Being Alive:                   Though Scalia s true murderer is heart disease, the Right is almost desperate to believe that the president had Scalia killed. One gentleman calling himself  NatureHacker manages to spin a particularly crazy theory that: This is a white house president government coverup. The fbi and cia with barack are probably involved. mercury nitrate may have been the poison of choice at dinner or the sulfate with lead, cadmium, radium, plutonium, uranium, or organophosphate. Roundup is an organophosphate that could have been used by leonard nimoy. This justice was killed and found dead. He died of a premeditated murder. Another term for this is that he was assasinated for his spot in the supreme court to be appointed by a liberal. NatureHacker  explains that, after a night of partying and gorging on food, Scalia  wakes up dead. What a coincidence,  Mr. Genius says sarcastically, explaining that Scalia was poisoned  to get him to die for Obama s agenda. Watch the insane rant below, and remember to VOTE BLUE in November. Not only does the next president appoint at least two Supreme Court Justices, but if conservatives have their way, he or she will appoint a third as well.

 Grab Your Popcorn: Ryan Bundy Pretty Much Just Volunteered For Prison,"Just when we think that the Bundy Militia morons couldn t possibly surpass the amount of stupid they have already demonstrated, one of them surprises us. On Friday, Ryan Bundy, leader of Y all Qaeda, decided that he didn t need no stinkin  lawyer and is going to represent himself.Bundy is facing charges for possession of firearms in a federal facility, conspiring to impede federal officers from doing their jobs at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, theft of government property as well as possessing and using a firearm while committing a violent act. He could face up to life in prison if convicted.U.S. District Court Judge Anna Brown warned Bundy that it wasn t a particularly bright idea to represent himself, saying, The stakes here are extremely high.  But Bundy was not dissuaded, he said that he was upset that his younger brother, Ammon Bundy, was told to let his lawyers speak for him during his hearing: I need to be able to speak when the time is right .I feel it very important that I need not be silenced when I need to be able to speak. The judge asked Bundy if he has any courtroom experience and he said he d represented himself before. However, the previous outcomes in those cases were not exactly favorable. As Oregon Live reported in January:2007: Arrested on suspicion of interfering with a legal arrest. He waived his right to an attorney and demanded a jury trial, only to change his plea to no contest on the day of the scheduled trial. He was sentenced to six months of probation in November 2008, ordered to take a life skills class and fined $500, court records show.2011: Found guilty of several vehicle-related citations, including an equipment violation and driving on a restricted license.2012: Arrested on an allegation of misdemeanor theft. A judge ordered the charges to be dropped if Bundy fulfilled 18 months of probation.2014: Charged with interfering with an animal officer. He pleaded no contest in April 2015, but not before he was arrested on a failure-to-appear warrant. He ended up paying a $150 fine.If this case turns out like those, he s definitely going to prison for a long time. Of course, that s where he and his fellow  occupiers  belong anyway   maybe the court will allow him te represent the rest of them too.

Australian women go pro on back of investment boom,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Lisa De Vanna once had to wash her sports bras in the sinks of cheap hotels to save money but the footballer is now relishing the good times as a surge of investment transforms women’s professional sport in Australia.  Over the last few months, De Vanna and her team mates in the ‘Matildas’ national soccer team have become the toast of the nation, playing to bumper home crowds even as their male counterparts struggle to qualify for the World Cup. The 2-1 defeat of Brazil in Sydney last Saturday drew some 15,000 fans, more than one of the weekend’s playoff matches in the hugely popular men’s Australian Football League and a rugby union international between Australia and Argentina. Another victory over the Brazilians on Tuesday attracted an even bigger crowd and, on Wednesday, Victoria sports minister John Eren proudly trumpeted that the state would host two Matildas friendlies against China in November. The recent success of the Matildas has played its part in the explosion of interest but it also echoes the development of women’s professional leagues in cricket and Australian Rules football, the popular indigenous sport. The large swell of support for a once-neglected outfit has been surreal for De Vanna, who after playing the 2007 World Cup had to return to her job as a petrol station attendant. Until quite recently, conditions were still “crap” for the country’s top women players, the plainspoken De Vanna told Reuters, using a more profane term to describe her early playing days. “I came in when they just had the (professional) contracts,” the prolific 32-year-old striker said in an interview. “I was still wearing boy’s clothes, still washing my undies and bras in the sink. We didn’t have internet, we were staying in budget hotels. “It was really tough back then but what we had was the love for the game and that hasn’t changed. “What’s changed is that we’ve got the proper support to be better athletes and it took a very long time for it to happen. But you’ve seen the outcome.” Basic salaries for women footballers in the domestic W-League remain modest, even if they are expected to double to A$15,500 ($12,300) next season. Top internationals, however, can expect to earn a respectable A$130,000 a year, giving young girls hope of carving out a full-time professional career — aspirations that were until recently only the province of talented boys. Cricket is another sport with growing opportunities for women.        Under the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, the average pay of international cricketers will more than double to A$180,000 in the 2017/18 season, according to figures from governing body Cricket Australia (CA). State players, on average, can expect A$55,000 and will be able to top that up by playing in the third season of the women’s Big Bash Twenty20 league. Underlining confidence in the women’s game, tickets for this year’s women’s Ashes cricket series against England will be sold for the first time rather than given away for free. CA has made significant investment in women’s sport and chief executive James Sutherland is “very confident” it will ultimately pay for itself. “I’m not under any illusions that success will come overnight,” Sutherland told Reuters. “That’s not the case. Beyond the economics of building demand and having the game pay for itself, either way, it’s still good economics to be investing into women’s cricket in the way that we do. “(It’s) increasing the profile of the game and creating a clear and obvious pathway for young females to pursue as they have so many choices.” Another pathway that has opened up only recently is in the women’s Australian Football League (AFLW), which proved a roaring success in its inaugural season this year. The AFL, the governing body of top flight Australian Rules football, had planned to launch the competition in 2020 but took the plunge after huge crowds turned out at exhibition games.   Debbie Lee, women’s football operations manager at the Melbourne Demons club and a key architect of the AFLW, had to pay to play her 300-odd games in the full-contact sport but women players can now earn up to A$40,000 a season. Free-to-air TV broadcasts of games have helped boost the tournament but its development is largely driven by a new wave of fans, Lee said. “There’s a whole swell of support from a new generation of young people who are asking, ‘Why shouldn’t women play football? Why shouldn’t have they have these opportunities, the same opportunities as men?’” New competition between the women’s sports is welcomed across the board by national federations, who see a chance to tap into new markets while fulfilling pledges to boost equal opportunity. But the rivalry may eventually get heated as the battle for talent heats up. Just like in the men’s sports, where rival codes fight bitterly to retain and lure marquee players, the movements of top women athletes are now covered closely in major newspapers. Former Matildas goalkeeper Brianna Davey played domestic soccer for Melbourne City last year but switched codes to play as a defender for Carlton in the AFLW. “It’s going to be really interesting,” said Lee. “Other sports will realize if they don’t have a good deal, they’ll lose their players.”  ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2017 ",1

Kurdish leader Barzani resigns after independence vote backfires,"ERBIL/BAGHDAD Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said he would give up his position as president on Nov. 1, after an independence referendum he championed backfired and triggered a regional crisis.  There was high drama at the Kurdish parliament, which was stormed by armed protesters as it met to approve the veteran leader s resignation as Kurdish president. Some MPs were barricaded in their offices on Sunday evening.     In a televised address, his first since Iraqi forces launched a surprise offensive to recapture Kurdish-held territory on Oct. 16, Barzani confirmed that he would not extend his presidential term after Nov. 1  under any conditions .  I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence,  said Barzani, who has campaigned for Kurdish self-determination for nearly four decades.  The address followed a letter he sent to parliament in which he asked members to take measures to fill the resulting power vacuum. The region s parliament met in the Kurdish capital Erbil on Sunday to discuss the letter. A majority of 70 Kurdish MPs voted to accept Barzani s request and 23 opposed it, Kurdish TV channels Rudaw and Kurdistan 24 said.  Demonstrators, some carrying clubs and guns, stormed the parliament building as the session was in progress. Gunshots were heard. Some protesters outside the building said they wanted to  punish  MPs who they said had  insulted  Barzani. Some attacked journalists at the scene. A Kurdish official had told Reuters on Saturday that Barzani had decided to hand over the presidency without waiting for elections that had been set for Nov. 1 but which have now been delayed by eight months. The region, which had enjoyed unprecedented autonomy for years, has been in turmoil since the independence referendum a month ago prompted military and economic retaliation from Iraq s central government in Baghdad. In his address, Barzani vigorously defended his decision to hold the Sept. 25 referendum, the results of which  can never be erased , he said. The vote was overwhelmingly for independence and triggered the military action by the Baghdad government and threats from neighboring Turkey and Iran.  He added that the Iraqi attack on Kirkuk and other Kurdish held territory vindicated his position that Baghdad no longer believed in federalism and instead wanted to curtail Kurdish rights.  Barzani condemned the United States for failing to back the Kurds.  We tried to stop bloodshed but the Iraqi forces and Popular Mobilization Front (Shi ite militias) kept advancing, using U.S. weapons,  he said.   Our people should now question, whether the U.S. was aware of Iraq s attack and why they did not prevent it.  Asked for reaction to Barzani s resignation, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said:  I would refer you to Kurdistan officials for information on President Barzani. Also, we are not going to get into any private diplomatic discussions.  Barzani has been criticized by Kurdish opponents for the loss of the city of Kirkuk, oil-rich and considered by many Kurds to be their spiritual home. His resignation could help facilitate a reconciliation between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Iraq s central government, whose retaliatory measures since the referendum have transformed the balance of power in the north.  Barzani has led the KRG since it was established in 2005. His second term expired in 2013 but was extended without elections being held as Islamic State militants swept across vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.     U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State but the alliance has faltered since the militants were largely defeated in the country.  After the Kurdish vote, Iraqi troops were ordered by the country s prime minister Haider al-Abadi to take control of areas claimed by both Baghdad and the KRG.  Abadi also wants to take control of the border crossings between the Kurdish region and Turkey, Iran and Syria, including one through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil. The fall of Kirkuk - a multi-ethnic city which lies outside the KRG s official boundaries - to Iraqi forces on Oct. 16 was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurds  independence drive because it halved the region s oil export revenue. Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga started a second round of talks on Sunday to resolve a conflict over control of the Kurdistan region s border crossings, Iraqi state TV said.  A first round was held on Friday and Saturday, with Abadi ordering a 24-hour suspension on Friday of military operations against Kurdish forces. He demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks, saying in a statement:  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution.

Argentine mid-term campaign pauses after body found in Patagonia,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Major parties running in Sunday s mid-term congressional election in Argentina suspended their campaigns on Wednesday after a body, thought to be that a young protester who went missing more than two months ago, was found in a river. A government spokeswoman said President Mauricio Macri s Cambiemos, or  Let s Change , coalition would halt campaigning for the rest of the day after investigators on Tuesday discovered the body in the Chubut River in the country s southern Patagonia region. The remains were found near the site where indigenous rights activist Santiago Maldonado was last seen at a tribal rights protest on Aug. 1. Former president and now Senate candidate Cristina Fernandez also suspended campaigning, along with other major figures vying for Congress, their campaigns said.  We have halted all events until there is word from either the judge in charge of the case or Santiago s family,  a spokesman for Fernandez s Unidad Ciudadana, or  Citizens  Unity  party told Reuters. In the final week of campaigning the Maldonado case has overshadowed the congressional election, which is expected to give Macri s coalition additional seats but not a majority in either chamber. Some opposition and rights groups believe state security forces took Maldonado, a 28-year-old craftsman, and allege Macri s government covered up information on his whereabouts. Macri s government has said that there is no evidence that shows security forces detained Maldonado. Potential cases of abuse by security forces are sensitive in Argentina, where the 1976-1983 military dictatorship secretly detained, tortured and killed people in clandestine prisons. Rights groups say up to 30,000 people  disappeared.  The markets will watch Sunday s election to see if  business-friendly Cambiemos emerges as the main vote-getter in the bellwether province of Buenos Aires. Investors say they prefer Macri s orthodox economic policies to those of Fernandez, a free-spending populist who led the country from 2008 to 2016.    While it has dominated headlines, political analysts have said they do not expect the case to change votes. ",worldnews,"October 18, 2017 ",1
Congress to fund more detention beds despite drop in border crossings,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Congress has agreed to fund an additional 5,300 detention beds for illegal immigrants, the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee said on Monday, less than half the number requested by President Donald Trump. The additional detention space was negotiated by Republican leaders with Democrats as part of a spending package Congress will vote on later this week to fund the government through September, according to two congressional sources familiar with the agreement.  The new beds will be added despite a sharp decline last month in apprehensions of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally. Immigration detention centers at the U.S. border have been operating at below capacity in recent months. The agreement will increase the number of immigration detention beds to 39,324 from 34,000 currently, according to a summary provided by the House Appropriations Committee. The White House in March requested bringing the total number of beds up to 45,700, saying the additional capacity was necessary to achieve the president’s goal of “enhancing interior enforcement efforts and ending ‘catch and release’ for those apprehended at the border.”   The budget summary did not break out the specific cost of the additional 5,300 beds, but said they would be included in an overall $1.5 billion increase in immigration enforcement funding.  The spending also includes more electronic monitoring and GPS tracking alternatives to detention, as well 100 additional officers to enforce immigration laws and funding for programs that increase coordination with local authorities on immigration enforcement.   A spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which runs detention facilities, said the agency would not comment on the contents of the spending bill while the legislation is pending. The House Appropriations Committee did not respond to a request for comment.  From April 1-22, an average of 36,235 immigrants were in detention per day, according to the most recent statistics provided by ICE.  If border crossings and apprehensions continue to stay low, the administration could struggle to fill additional detention beds, unless it increases “arrests of undocumented immigrants in the interior with no criminal convictions and cuts back on releases of asylum seekers found to have legitimate claims,” said Kevin Landy, who served as assistant director at ICE during the Obama administration.     “ICE is going to be under enormous pressure to fill those beds” to prove to Congress that the funding was needed, said Landy, who left his post in January. Democrats raised similar concerns during budget negotiations, a Congressional aide with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters.  Some Republicans as well as Democrats also expressed worries during the negotiations that the Department of Homeland Security might redirect money allotted for detention centers to use on border wall construction if Congress appropriated more money than needed, the aide said.  In October, the first month of the 2017 fiscal year, 66,710 people were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Apprehensions have fallen steadily since then.    In March, 16,600 individuals were apprehended, down 64 percent from the year-earlier month, according to statistics from Customs and Border Patrol.

Blumenthal asks antitrust pick to discuss White House role in AT&T deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said on Wednesday that he asked President Donald Trump’s top antitrust pick to meet to discuss any contact he has had with the White House regarding AT&T’s (T.N) plan to merge with Time Warner (TWX.N). Blumenthal told reporters on Capitol Hill that he requested the meeting with Makan Delrahim in the wake of a New York Times report that White House advisers battling television news station CNN mulled using a government review of AT&T’s merger plans as leverage. Delrahim was nominated to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust at the Justice Department and is awaiting Senate confirmation. The department’s Antitrust Division will decide whether the deal is legal under U.S. law. “(The White House) is ethically and morally barred from intervening,” said Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. “The mere threat of it is a very serious potential violation of ethics.” On Tuesday, Bob Quinn, a spokesman for AT&T, declined to discuss the report. Quinn said that AT&T believes it can complete regulatory reviews and close the deal by the end of the year. Blumenthal also said that he had written to the CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner about the report. Blumenthal’s remarks echo those of Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, who said last week in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that “any political interference in antitrust enforcement is unacceptable.” Trump himself has not commented publicly on the deal since the election but during his campaign he said it was an example of a “power structure” that was rigged against him and “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Blumenthal said that Delrahim had not yet responded to the request. The Justice Department declined comment. ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2017 ",1
" Wealthy Man Passes Away, Leaves Millions To Open Ohio Animal Shelter","The news cycle has been filled with bad news lately, and it s wearing on us all. We have an income gap that keeps getting wider, a horrible reality star on his way to possibly becoming president, mass shootings, terrorist attacks and all sorts of other awful stuff that makes us shake our heads when we turn on the news. So, it s always nice when we can bring you news that will warm your hearts and make you smile   and the following story will do just that.David Robert Wetzell (known as  Bob ), of Urbana, Ohio passed away and left his entire estate to establish an Animal Welfare League in Champaign County. According to the executor of his estate, Ronald Tompkins, Wetzell left instructions for him to liquidate his estate   worth about $3 million   and build the shelter, but with very specific guidelines.Wetzell left instructions in his will for Tompkins to sell his assets and use the money to establish the shelter and purchase a secluded farm in Champaign County. It is to be used as an animal preserve, pet cemetery, dog training facility and rehabilitation home for unwanted pets.The new shelter will be modeled after Animal Welfare League of Clark County in Springfield which was established in 1959 and currently houses 90 cats and 45 dogs. Libby Adams who runs the Clark County shelter with her husband said: I know it will take a while to build up to what we have. It s not going to happen overnight. Ours took a few years to get to what we have now Bob was very fond and proud of our organization. He would come down on occasion. He was a member of our league for as long as I can remember and supported us. She said that he often told her that he wanted to open one up when he was alive, but he didn t know how to go about getting it started.Wetzell had no human family members except a few distant cousins, but he was survived by six cats, a 20-year-old parakeet, a dog and seven chickens. Tompkins kept the dog and found homes for his other pets.It is awesome that Wetzell did something like this with his estate. There are so many animals that need a home, and this sounds like it is going to be a pet paradise. I wish there were more people in the world like him.

 WATCH: Chris Wallace NAILS Trump For Touting Jobs Reports He Once Called ‘Phony’,"Donald Trump is the ultimate hypocrite and Fox host Chris Wallace called him out for it on Sunday.During the campaign, Trump repeatedly bashed positive monthly jobs reports by claiming that they were somehow being faked by President Obama to make it appear that the economy was improving under his watch. Trump dismissed the low unemployment rate as well, claiming that he  heard  that it was much higher, as high as 42 percent, which is an outrageous lie.Chris Wallace played footage of this while interviewing Trump s chief economic adviser and former Goldman Sachs executive. You know, the same Goldman Sachs that Donald Trump repeatedly vilified during the campaign because of Hillary Clinton s ties to them.Anyway, Wallace pointed out that while Trump is touting the recent February jobs report that shows the economy added 235,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 to 4.7 percent, he is clearly being a hypocrite because he called previous jobs reports  phony. If that s true, why should we believe these numbers?  Wallace demanded to know before noting that Trump inherited a strengthening economy from the Obama administration.  And the fact is, did you inherit an economy that has been for the last 18 months somewhere between 4.6 and 5 percent unemployment? Of course, rather than admit that Trump is full of shit, Cohn ignored the question and made it sound like Trump is an economic hero. The economy continues to grow and we are doing out part, Cohn said before claiming that CEOs are telling Trump that they are adding jobs because of him. We are creating these jobs because of you, Mr. President, and your policies.  Which have not, yet, come into any sort of effect.Here s the video via YouTube:The bottom line is that the economy is continuing to grow because of President Obama s economic policies. Many of the investment plans that companies are announcing right now were in motion well before the election in November. But Trump has been desperately trying to take credit for the economy.So let s all remember how Trump is currently taking credit for all the good economic news. Because once the economy implodes under his watch, he ll definitely try to blame the black guy for it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"March 12, 2017",0
(VIDEO) OBAMA ON LETTERMAN: “WE IGNORE POCKETS OF POVERTY” BUT OBAMA’S STIMULUS GAVE $1.8 BILLION TO BALTIMORE,"The stats don t lie on this one Obama s hoping to reach the low information voter who watches Letterman and will buy this bs. The stimulus under Obama gave BILLIONS for work programs and education but we still need to give more??? As a taxpaying American I am 100% FED Up! and ready for the black community to take responsibility for their towns and their youth. We DO NOT ignore pockets of poverty but I would say that we ignore the truth of what s going on in the black community and what s the real problem here. It s just like when the main stream media ignores and covers up the bad behavior of groups of black teens. We ve reported on numerous cases of this bad behavior that caused damage and physical harm to others. The latest case was ironically in Baltimore and the local press called the offenders  kids  when you can see clearly that these are teens. Downplaying and not punishing the bad behavior by these teens only makes it worse. No consequences breeds chaos President Obama said that  too often we ignore   pockets of poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of education  on Monday s  Late Show  on CBS.Obama said,  it s important that now that charges have been brought in Baltimore, that we let due process play itself out. Those officers who have been charged, they deserve, to be represented, and to let the legal system work its way through. We don t have all the facts yet, and that that s going to be presented in a court of law. I think it s also really important to remember that the overwhelming number of police officers are doing an outstanding job, we re in New York, today,   we re in New York today, where a young officer lost his life doing his job, and families of officers all across the country every day, they re wondering  is my loved one going to come home?  And so they ve got a really tough job. He continued,  what we also know, though, is that for far too long, for decades, you have a situation in which too many communities don t have a relationship of trust with the police, and if you just have a handful of police who are not doing the right thing, that makes the job tougher for all the other police officers out there. It creates an environment in the community where they feel as if, rather than being protected and served, they re the targets of arbitrary arrests or stops, and so our job has to be to rebuild trust, and we put forward a task force made up of police officers, but also young activists who have been protesting in Ferguson, or here in New York. They came up with some terrific recommendations about collecting data on what happens when there s a shooting involving police, what are we doing in terms of things like body cameras, and so there s some very practical, concrete things we can do to make the system work better.

Race Obsessed Democrat Congressman CAUGHT Allowing Daughter To Use Vehicle With Congressional Plates As Taxi For Hire,"Of course, Black Caucus member and loudmouth activist, Rep. Cummings would be the first to let everyone know how outraged he was if this what a white congressman A Lyft car adorned with congressional plates that went viral on social media belongs to Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), The Washington Post reported Tuesday.A photo submitted to local Washington, D.C., blog Popville last week depicted a black Honda with a pink Lyft driver sticker on its window shield and the words  Maryland U.S. Congress 7-A  on its license plates.Cummings told The Washington Post that his daughter   who just graduated from Howard University   has been using the car to drive for Lyft and earn extra income. In an effort to earn some extra money to pay her expenses at school, she signed up for a part-time position with one of the ride-sharing companies,  Cummings said.  They, in turn, gave her a sticker to apply to the windshield of the car. Cummings added that he has asked his daughter to remove the congressional plates, which afford special parking privileges for members and staffers.Allen B.

Either we will move forward in 2016 with public policies that support greater opportunity for everyone or we will continue to sink deeper into economic inequality, injustice and violence.

Tillerson's Asia trip not seen producing concrete action on North Korea: State Dept,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will have “substantive, hard” talks with U.S. partners in Asia on next steps in dealing with North Korea, but his visit this week is not likely to produce an immediate specific response, the State Department said on Wednesday. “I wouldn’t predict that there’s going to be concrete action out of his trip,” State Department spokesman Mark Toner told a briefing on Wednesday when asked if Tillerson expected firm commitments on moving forward against North Korea. “I think this is a chance for him to have a lot of substantive, hard discussions with our allies and partners in the region about possible next steps, again recognizing that the threat of North Korea, frankly, is only growing stronger,” Toner said. Tillerson is visiting South Korea, Japan and China on his Asia trip. Asked what Tillerson would tell Asian trading partners following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal negotiated by his predecessor, Toner said the secretary’s message would be that trade is a vital U.S. stimulus. “We want to pursue trade, we believe in trade,” Toner said. “Trade is good for American workers, it’s good for American companies, but we want to do that on a bilateral basis and ... we want to ensure a level playing field for U.S. workers and U.S. companies.” ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2017 ",1

House committee launches review of FDA criminal office,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee has launched an examination of the Food and Drug Administration’s criminal office, raising questions about the unit’s management and handling of cases involving food, drugs and devices. The House Energy and Commerce Committee told FDA Commissioner Robert Califf it is “examining management concerns” and “possible morale concerns with the field offices” of the Office of Criminal Investigations. The September 20 letter, signed by committee chairman Fred Upton and Tim Murphy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, seeks answers to a detailed list of questions by October 12. Among other issues, the House committee questions why George Karavetsos, director of the Rockville, Maryland-based FDA criminal office, is allowed to run the unit from an office in South Florida, near his home. An FDA spokeswoman said the agency received the letter and will respond to the committee directly. The House questions come two weeks after Reuters reported how some FDA agents complain criminal office managers have forced them to pursue cases involving mislabeled foreign-imported injectable drugs, at the expense of cases with more potential to protect the public health. Current and former agents complain they have turned into the “Botox Police,” spending thousands of hours chasing doctors who purchased authentic versions of Allergan’s anti-wrinkle drug that were labeled for use in other countries. Some agents say their efforts have done little more than protect the pharmaceutical industry’s high drug prices in the United States. Those concerns come as the criminal office has had mixed success in bringing cases. From fiscal year 2008-2015, Reuters found, more than half of all opened OCI cases were closed without action. The House committee asked Califf to explain the process for how criminal cases get opened, and to provide statistics on OCI’s arrests, convictions, case initiations and amount of money recovered. Reuters also reported on Karavetsos’ relocation to Florida, a move that came less than two years after the FDA paid more than $25,000 to move him to Maryland. Karavetsos, in a prior interview, defended the office’s efforts, saying statistics are not a fair measure of OCI’s success because public health and safety will “always trump the criminal investigation.”  FDA Regulatory Affairs Associate Commissioner Melinda Plaisier defended Karavetsos’ move to Miami, saying it was good for the FDA and his family. The House committee letter also questions how the FDA responded to two prior reports, from the Government Accountability Office and the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, that were critical of the criminal office. The 2012 OIG report cited problems with how the Rockville-based office is run and concluded that field offices “lack the discretion” to open cases to address “food and drug concerns prevalent in their locales.” The report cited a lack of independence within the FDA’s criminal office. OCI is housed within the Office of Regulatory Affairs, which is responsible for compliance inspections and helps determine the criminal office’s budget. The inspector general recommended structural changes to “ensure the independence of investigations.” FDA leadership at that time rejected those suggestions. The criminal office headquarters controls the opening of investigations. Some agents have questioned the office’s priorities and say they have, on occasion, been told not to open cases involving other federal agencies. A September 2015 email from Robert West, the recently retired Special Agent in Charge of the Miami field office, is one example. West, in the email, contended agencies including the FBI, the HHS OIG and Homeland Security investigators “were riding our coattails and were not bringing anything to the table.” Involving those agencies in an investigation from day one, he wrote, “is unacceptable.” West previously declined interview requests. Reuters could not immediately reach him Tuesday through an FDA spokeswoman. ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2016 ",1

 WATCH: Giuliani’s BIG LIE At Trump Rally Is Jaw-Dropping,"Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has been recently designated by the Donald Trump for President campaign as their go-to opener for his campaign rallies. He did so in jaw-dropping fashion on Monday as the Trump campaign launched another event with a bizarre statement.Hyping up Trump, Giuliani made the insane statement that before the presidency of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State, the United States didn t  have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the U.S. Video of Rudy saying we didn't ""have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the U.S."" before Obama: pic.twitter.com/3tC1InfZj0  andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) August 15, 2016Of course, the reality is that the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States was perpetrated by radical Islamic terrorists under the banner of al Qaeda on September 11, 2001.The attacks killed thousands of people in New York City, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania.The statement is even more jaw-dropping because few major politicians are as identified with 9/11 as Giuliani, who served as mayor of New York City on the day of the attack and famously walked with firefighters and police through the rubble after the attacks.He even based much of his failed 2004 presidential run on his actions on that day.The president at the time was of course President George W. Bush, the Republican. By contrast, Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. marines on May 2, 2011 in a raid on his compound in Afghanistan that was ordered by President Barack Obama.The conservative movement has for years tried to argue that they are stronger against terrorism than Democrats, and as an outgrowth they have worked to down play Democratic successes in that fight. There has been an intense crackdown on terrorists during Obama s seven years as President, including rolling up on the al Qaeda network, ISIS, and other groups.Giuliani s statement is a blatant lie, but it has strong support with hardcore conservatives.Featured image via Twitter",News,"August 15, 2016",0

 Comedian Margaret Cho Compares Donald Trump To Roman Emperor Nero," We re paying so much attention to Donald Trump,  Comedian Margaret Cho told Addicting Info in a phone interview. Ms. Cho has openly endorsed Bernie Sanders, but has applauded Hillary Clinton s political efforts as well.  What he has done to politics is a travesty. It s a real embarrassment to the nature of politics in America. This was a dignified profession. There is a circus element to him. It s almost like we re looking at Nero. Nero is infamously known as the most tyrannical and insane emperor s Rome ever had. After taking the throne at the age of 17, Nero had his mother killed, was known for overt self-indulging and had anyone who dissented against him killed. For leisure, Nero would wander the streets of Rome and murder people at random.  After a fire burned most of Rome to the ground, Nero pointed the finger at Christians, which began a reign of persecuting and torturing anyone associated with the religion, similar to the rhetoric from Donald Trump against Muslims. A few years later, Rome finally rebelled against Nero s tyrannical rule, and Nero committed suicide, leaving no heir to the throne and a free for all among Rome s military generals to seize power.The rise of Donald Trump has invoked similar fears that such a tyrannical ruler could become President of the United States. Although, it is incredibly unlikely Donald Trump would ever reach the extent Nero did, with the support of a GOP majority in Congress, Donald Trump would likely reverse decades of progressive reforms Democrats have worked endlessly to push into legislation. The Supreme Court could possibly receive a judge incredibly unfit to be serving in such a capacity. Groups such as those who identify with the Muslim religion would be in even greater danger of their rights being taken away as Donald Trump has made proposals similar to those enacted by Adolf Hitler preceding the Holocaust during World War II. The comparisons to Hitler are not that far off,  added Ms. Cho.  It s a very dangerous time.  Senator Ted Cruz doesn t offer any better of an option for Republicans, who may face a brokered convention as many leaders in the party don t want Donald Trump or Ted Cruz as their nominee either.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 3, 2016",0
Macron's ideas can bolster Franco-German axis: Merkel,"TALLINN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the ideas of French President Emmanuel Macron for reform of the European Union on Thursday and said they could form the basis for intensive Franco-German cooperation. Macron offered a sweeping vision for Europe s future in a speech on Tuesday, calling for the EU to cooperate more closely on defense, immigration, tax and social policy, and for the single currency bloc to have its own budget.  As far as the proposals were concerned, there was a high level of agreement between German and France. We must still discuss the details, but I am of the firm conviction that Europe can t just stay still but must continue to develop,  Merkel told reporters before a meeting with Macron in the Estonian capital Tallinn. Merkel, who was speaking before a gathering of all EU leaders for a summit on Europe s digital economy, said that Europe had an interest in fighting protectionism and was looking to sign free trade agreements with other countries. She also said that Macron had made clear that Germany and France wanted to work closely on harmonizing corporate tax and insolvency law.  I think that s very positive. I see a good basis in the speech of the French president for France and Germany to cooperate intensively in future,  she said.     ",worldnews,"September 28, 2017 ",1
" In STUNNING Admission, John McCain Just Handed Democrats The Senate (AUDIO)","If Republicans want to lose Congress, there s one surefire way: let Americans know that they will be in for at least two more years of gridlock and obstruction if they win. John McCain, in a stunning admission, promised exactly that.In a radio interview on Philadelphia s 1210 WPHT radio on Monday, McCain wasn t able to say with certainty that Donald Trump would be better at nominating Supreme Court justices than Hillary Clinton would be, but he does promise that if Clinton wins, there s no way the Senate will ever vote on one of her Supreme Court nominees.Later in the interview, McCain used the opportunity to make the case for fellow Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is locked in a close battle to retain his Senate seat in Pennsylvania. McCain promised that Republicans would be  united against any Supreme Court nominee  put forth by Clinton. I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,  McCain said.  I promise you. This is where we need the majority and Pat Toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the Senate as anyone I have encountered. Source: CNNHere s the audio:Voters won t buy it. While McCain s seat is pretty safe, the Senate as a whole is not. Republicans have to win at least 21 seats to retain their majority in the Senate. Democrats only need 15. It s not just that, either. Voters know that it s Congress, not President Obama, who is responsible for the gridlock in Washington, and they are sick of it. Most Americans want the Senate to give Obama s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a hearing and ultimately, an up or down vote. Instead, McCain and Republicans are promising more of the same, which is absolutely nothing. Trust me, Americans will punish them at the polls, especially as Donald Trump s campaign continues its downward spiral.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"October 17, 2016",0
U.S. tax bill may face lawsuits with long odds but political payoffs,"(Reuters) - Democratic-leaning states may take legal action to challenge the cap on deductions of state and local taxes under the sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code, and even though such lawsuits would face long odds they could help galvanize Democrats for next year’s mid-term election. The U.S. tax bill, passed by Republicans in Congress on Wednesday, limits deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as SALT, to $10,000. The provision hits hardest Democratic-leaning states with high incomes, high property values and high taxes, like New York, New Jersey and California.  Law professors said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states’ rights under the U.S. Constitution. Some political strategists see a win for Democrats regardless of how courts ultimately rule, saying that lawsuits could be used to keep the issue front and center for voters already largely disenchanted with the Republican party. “It’s a no-brainer for them to do this,” said Democratic political consultant Phil Singer. “Failing to aggressively pursue a remedy would be political malpractice.” New Jersey Governor-elect Phil Murphy said during an appearance on CNBC on Wednesday that “everything is on the table” for New Jersey to oppose the bill, including challenging its “legality and constitutionality.”  The governors of California and New York, Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo, have both previously said they were exploring legal challenges to SALT deduction limits. Their offices did not return requests for comment on Wednesday. Since President Donald Trump took office, blue states have aggressively used the courts to attempt to block the president’s agenda, suing over his proposed travel ban, environmental policies and other measures. William O’Reilly, a conservative political consultant in New York, said the SALT deduction issue would likely add to Republicans’ “suburbia problem” among college-educated voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. “They already had one because of this president’s style,” O’Reilly said. Darien Shanske, a tax law professor at the University of California Davis School of Law, said the governors would probably argue that restricting the SALT deduction, which dates back to the introduction of the federal income tax in 1862, violates the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment that protects states’ rights. Shanske and other tax experts said the federalism argument would need to overcome the U.S. Supreme Court’s historically broad interpretations of Congress’ 16th Amendment power to impose taxes. “As a general matter, nothing prevents the federal government from changing the SALT deduction,” said David Gamage, a professor of tax law at Indiana University’s Maurer School of Law. In a frequently cited 1934 decision, the Supreme Court called tax deductions a “legislative grace” rather than a right, and said Congress has broad leeway to abolish them. The court reiterated this view in a 1988 decision allowing Congress to remove a federal tax exemption for interest on some state and local bonds.  Kirk Stark, a professor of tax law at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, said there is a slight possibility that a federalism argument against limiting the SALT deduction could gain traction. “Courts create new law all the time,” he said, noting that decisions on matters this sweeping tend to become political. But some legal experts noted that the state’s rights argument is more typically a conservative position. Using it to challenge the SALT provision could be a move that Democratic governors come to regret in the future, said Daniel Hemel, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.   “The progressive agenda depends on the federal government being able to raise revenue and the Supreme Court not getting in the way of that,” Hemel said.

 How John Oliver And A Cat Created An International Incident (VIDEO),"Since John Oliver left the Daily Show to take a spot on HBO, his is one of the few satirical news shows to regularly follow international news. As it turns out, dictators don t generally respond well to satire and Oliver has found himself in a bit of a brush up with the Kremlin-backed ruler of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov   all over a lost cat.In a segment on HBO s Last Week Tonight, Oliver ridiculed the friend of Putin after Kadyrov took to Instagram to ask the world to help find his cat, which he called a  toyger,  which as you might guess, is a cat that has been bred to look like a tiger cub.         .          .      ,            .          -   .      ,    -   ,              ,        ,        .          .  ,      -       .        ,      .  ,              .            ,    -   .      ???????? #  #  #  #  # A photo posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95) on May 16, 2016 at 4:29am PDTUnfortunately, without the help of unreliable translation software, we don t know exactly what the post says, but he did ask for help and he did say that  we have begun to seriously worry,  asking people who have seen the cat to get in touch.Now, Kadyrov is not a nice person, despite his apparent love of cats, so Oliver couldn t leave it alone. Not only did he release the video, but Oliver trolled the leader on Twitter.Here s the video:And this: .@RKadyrov Is this your cat? pic.twitter.com/2UacV3km7J  John Oliver (@iamjohnoliver) May 23, 2016Featured image via Twitter.

I got used to share with my friends in Instagram with all news, including cat issues. And this time I didn t want to leave as a secret the cat s adventures. I receive lots of photos. Some people say that they saw the cat in Vladivostok, Japan, Iceland, New Zealand, and even in the Oval Office of the White House! I am grateful to all, but this is NOT my cat. It became known that even the American TV channel  HBO  joined to search. The anchorman comedian   John Oliver asks millions of viewers to look for a cat. I knew long ago that in the USA unevenly breathe to my younger friends. One day horses aren t allowed to jump, the other   a cat is a real star of a show. Oliver laments a fact that we put on t-shirts with a photo of the President of Russia   Vladimir Putin. Yes, millions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader. For this purpose, there is a good motivation. Vladimir Vladimirovich is a wise, courageous, resolute Head, who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign, which is conducted by the USA and its assistants. Thanks to Putin, we have crushed terrorists among whom there were also citizens of the USA, and European citizens. The country directed by Obama under the guise of peacekeeping operations spark new wars and bloody internal conflicts, in which die millions of people. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria  That s why there is nothing surprising that Oliver also got a wish to appear publicly in a T-shirt with an image of Putin, but not Obama. #Kadyrov #Russia #Chechnya #USA #HBO #Oliver #findkadyrovscat #Ihavenotseenyourcat #IHAVESEENYOURCATA photo posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95) on May 23, 2016 at 11:41am PDTThis would all be funny, and well, it actually is, but Kadyrov is one of the most notorious human rights abusers in the world and if he has his way, he ll have a lot more influence in the coming months and years. At just 39, the anti-Muslim activist is looking for a position to be made for him in the Kremlin.Critics accuse the leader of kidnapping, torture, torching of homes and other human rights abuses. According to Human Rights Watch, Kadyrov shuts down all critics in Chechnya and now he s trying to shut one down in the United States. Kadyrov is also a strong admirer of Russian strong-man dictator, Vladimir Putin.He said it was no surprise that he liked to wear Putin T-shirts, and that  millions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader .

Sign-up pace slows in third week of 2018 Obamacare enrollment,"(Reuters) - The pace slowed in the third week of enrollment for 2018 Obamacare individual insurance as nearly 800,000 people signed up through the federal government website HealthCare.gov, down about 75,000 people from the previous week, a U.S. government agency reported on Wednesday.   There was an increase, however, in the number of new consumers to the program created by former President Barack Obama, to 220,323 from 208,397 in the previous week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said.  Republican President Donald Trump and lawmakers are trying to undo Obama’s health law but do not have enough votes to repeal it and so must continue to run the insurance program, which offers income-based subsidies. Uncertainty over its future drove 2018 monthly premiums up more than 30 percent on average as insurers such as Anthem Inc, Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare sought to cover higher costs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 11 million will enroll in 2018, up from 2017’s 10 million, even as the period for sign-ups has been cut in half to six weeks and will end on Dec. 15. Total sign-ups for Obamacare individual insurance in the 39 states that use HealthCare.gov reached 2.28 million during the first three weeks of enrollment. The figures do not include enrollment in Washington, D.C. or the 11 states including New York and California that run their own enrollment and websites.  Among the states using HealthCare.gov with the highest number of individuals signing up were Florida, 498,168; Texas, 271,737; North Carolina, 138,932; Georgia, 119,968; and Pennsylvania, 101,286, the agency said.

" Trump Tries To Launch 2020 Re-election Ad, It IMMEDIATELY Blows Up In His Face (TWEET)","From the moment Trump won the election, he was already bragging about how he was going to run again in 2020, and win.In a move that shows just how delusional Trump truly is, the undeserving POTUS ignored the fact that his approval rating has reached a historic low by launching his first ad for his 2020 bid. And in true Trump fashion, the ad was one big embarrassing fail, as Trump was forced to pull the ad over an obvious violation   it violated the ban that prevents active duty military members in uniform from participating in political stunts.The Washington Post wrote: The initial version of the ad released by the campaign included a shot of Trump shaking hands at his Mar-a-Lago estate with H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser. An updated version dropped the shot of McMaster, who remains an active duty member of the Army, and replaced it with Trump visiting a business. Campaign law expert Larry Noble also pointed this out:It should be noted that Trump pathetically celebrated Inauguration Day by filing for re-election, probably to soothe himself after seeing those tiny crowds. This ad is the perfect embodiment of Trump s sloppy administration   these people have no idea how to run the country, which trickles down to the most simple tasks.From what we ve seen from Trump himself, his White House doesn t really pay attention to detail or do their research first before going all in. Trump s team has had to repeatedly correct themselves, and not even a simple campaign ad can go off without a hitch.Not even halfway through his first term, Trump has already made his bid for re-election a joke and displayed just how incompetent his entire team is. It s no wonder the majority of Americans can t wait until this clown and the rest of his circus are out of the White House.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017",0
The Jerusalem Decision: From Creative Chaos to Effective Turmoil," Dr Can Erimtan 21st Century WireDid Donald J. Trump have any idea about the impact his words would have across the world?!? Did he have any idea that the whole wide world, including the United Nations, would turn against him?On Wednesday, 6 December 2017, in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room the President of the United States proceeded to make history, or, proceeded to leave his personal mark on the flow of world events as his words set a whole chain of global events in motion: I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering. In his preamble to this potentially explosive and arguably rather disconcerting statement, Trump explained that  [i]n 1995, [under Bill Clinton s watch, that is] Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city   and so importantly   is Israel s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.  In this way, the 45th U.S. President showed himself to have been cut from a completely different cloth indeed, as he uttered words that neither Bill Clinton, nor George W. Bush or, more importantly perhaps, Barack Obama had dared speak.Yes, Trump openly came out and made plain the deep love that dare not speak its name   in spite of the vehemently pro-Israel stance taken by the U.S. ever since the time of President Eisenhower (1953-61) and particularly, ever since the Six Day War (5-10 June 1967), in spite of the ceaseless activities of AIPAC and J Street, no previous incumbent had dared bestow a bona fide U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as a physical token of the deep and ardent bonds between the New World and the Promised Land. Only, Donald J. Trump had the gall to  deliver,  doing what Clinton had promised yet none of his successors had been able to realise . . . until now, that is.In true Aristotelian fashion Trump took the potentiality that was Jerusalem (known as Al Quds or the Sacred City in the Muslim world) and turned it into an actuality by means of pledging full ambassadorial honours for the ancient city. Following these presidential words, outspoken Israeli voices did not take long to heap praise on the White House. Mark Regev, the erstwhile spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem (2004-7) and frequent Israeli apologist appearing on various mainstream media, and currently even active as Israeli Ambassador in London (since 2015) blurted out that he  think[s] this was a just move and a good move for peace. His boss, Bibi or Benjamin Netanyahu (fourth premiership, 2015 present) was equally forthcoming, talking to the press on the same day the U.S. President made his performance in the Diplomatic Reception Room:  Thank you President Trump for today s historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.  The PM in the next instance also echoed his ambassador s words, declaring that  [t]here is no peace that doesn t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The idea that Jerusalem should be at the heart of the Jewish people s  land and nation namely has its roots in the Bible, in 2 Chronicles 6:5-6, to be precise:  Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel. But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel,  as worded in the New International Version. And Bibi knows that too.Bibi even took his words of praise abroad. First to Paris, where he met with President Emmanuel Macron, who had urged his U.S. counterpart to preserve the city s status quo prior to Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room performance (10 December 2017). Bibi disagreed volubly with the Frenchman, characterising as  absurd  anyone not willing to recognise the  millennial connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem.  Next, even proceeding to refer to God s word that had elevated Jerusalem to its lofty position as site for his temple:  [y]ou can read it in a very fine book   it s called the Bible.  The following day he went to Brussels, where he attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (11 December 2017). The Israeli PM told the gathered EU FM as well as the assembled press corps that Trump s Jerusalem declaration  makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace. The Invention of the Jewish People and the Position of Jerusalem in IslamThe state of Israel, as a Jewish nation state implanted on Middle Eastern soil in 1948, employs nationalist myth and religious tradition as credible arguments justifying its mere existence. The Israeli journalist and author Daniel Gavron, for example, states that  most Israelis [regard it as] axiomatic that the celebrations for the 3,000th anniversary of the conquest of Jerusalem by King David [in 1995] mark[ed] a real and tangible event,  even though he himself doubts its authenticity. In other words, the Jewish people, as a shorthand for the Israeli citzenry, have apparently already been following the political and ideological leanings currently exhorted by Bibi for quite a while. But, as I explained at length some time ago, the mere mention of the term  nation  or even just  people  is a problematic issue in its own right   the point that I am trying to get across is that  nations  or  people  cannot be perceived as  natural  or even  organic  phenomena, but rather as contrived and constructed social units consisting of individuals who willingly become part of a larger  artificial  whole through the manipulation and management of larger forces and structures   leaders of men and their organisations. It has been nearly ten years now that the historian Schlomo Sand published his groundbreaking text The Invention of the Jewish People, which attempted to popularise the theoretical constructs of writers and thinkers like Benedict Anderson and Ernst Gellner, amongst others, but, as seems blatantly apparent from looking at Bibi s recent proclamations, his message has clearly failed to penetrate the academic bubble, in spite of having topped Israeli bestseller list  for nineteen weeks. With regard to the city of Jerusalem, on the other hand, archeological evidence appears to prove conclusivedly that the  site has been continuously occupied for some 5,000 years,  signalling the urban centre s pre-Jewish roots. But the notion that King David conquered the place to establish the one true god s temple seems rather shaky. Gavron explains that the  biblical account of the capture of the city is the only one we have, and in the opinion of most modern scholars, the Bible is not an entirely reliable historical document.  Still, archeological excavations carried out in the summer of 1993 appear to have produced evidence that a certain David indeed founded a dynastic live in the 10th century BCE   namely, a small  triangular piece of basalt rock . . . subsequently identified as part of a victory pillar erected by the king of Syria and later smashed by an Israelite ruler  carrying an Aramaic inscription talking about a  Beit David ( House  or  Dynasty of David ). But the Jewish  conquest  of Jerusalem did not mark the end of the city s story of military takeover and/or occupation: remaining in ancient times, the Assyrian King Sennacherib laid siege to the city in the year 701 BCE, whereas the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar captured the city in the seventh year of his reign (598 BCE), but of greater importance is the sack and destruction of the city and its temple at the hands of Titus, son of the Roman Emperor Vespasian (70 CE), in response to the Jews  Great Revolt against Rome that had sprung up in 66 CE. The ultimate outcome of Rome s harsh response was the  Diaspora,  as explained by the American rabbi, lecturer, and author Joseph Telushkin, who estimates that  as many as one million Jews died  as a result, while carrying in its wake the  almost two-thousand-year span of Jewish homelessness and exile.  With the majority of Jews apparently dispersed from the land and city, Jerusalem was eventually conquered by the Caliph Umar (reign 634-44) in the year 638, an event which seems to have taken place following a  peaceful siege, no blood was shed,  in the words of Zia H Shah, a New York-based physician and the Chief Editor of the Muslim Times. The addition of Jerusalem to the Dar al-Islam (or, the abode of Islam) was important. Though the city s name does not appear specifically in the Quran (containing only a reference to  al-Masjid al- Aqsa  or the  Furthest Mosque,  17:1), it is the locus of the Prophet s miraculous Night Journey (or Mi raj). The story, as related in various prophetic traditions (or hadith), tells how the figure of the Prophet travelled from  Makkah to the Furthest Mosque (in Jerusalem), from whence he ascended Heaven, so that Allah might  show him of Our signs. As a result, the Masjid al- Aqsa, arguably built by the Caliph Umar though no historical records exist to this effect, is regarded as the third most sacred mosque in Islam, following the Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah, and Al Masjid An-Nabawi in Madinah.A Pseudo-Ottoman Gambit: Diverting Attention for a PurposeAs a result, Donald Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room stunt far supersedes the thorny Palestinian issue, the life-and-death matter of peace in the Middle East, or even the real estate division between East and West Jerusalem. The English-language pan-Arab television channel Al Jazeera English matter-of-factly point out on its website that  [v]iolence, protests and arrests have followed US President Donald Trump s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. All across the globe Muslims have taken to the street to voice their disapproval of Trump s latest attempt to act like a real president, a president unlike any of his predecessors:  [r]allies against Trump s decision also took place in the Indian city of Mumbai, the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and the Japanese capital, Tokyo.  But also in Turkey   where President Recept Tayyip Erdo an (aka the Prez)  has been at pains for years to appear as a rightful heir to the Ottoman sultans of old   after all, Sultan Selim I (1512-20) took hold of the city of Jerusalem in 1517, remaining part of the Ottoman fold till the onset of the British Mandate (1917-48). On Thursday and Friday, (7-8 December 2017),  spontaneous  meetings took place throughout the whole of the country, from Istanbul over Bursa, Ankara, and Mersin, to Hatay, Gaziantep, Tatvan, Adana, Van, and Kahramanmara . More importantly, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held a meeting in Istanbul on 13 December 2017, and the Prez employed this platform to portray himself as the ultimate champion of Islam, defying not just the United States of America and Israel, but also the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nominal Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. As I have written quite some time ago, the Prez is more than determined to challenge his erstwhile friend and ally King Salman and see himself as the rightful Calip of the world of Islam, in true pseudo-Ottoman fashion.The OIC meeting dutifully released its  Istanbul Declaration on  Freedom for Al Quds' : [a]ppreciating the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish people for hosting the Extraordinary Islamic Summit regarding this important cause of Ummah, especially the call for this Extraordinary Summit made by His Excellency Recep Tayyip Erdo an (image, left), President of the Republic of Turkey . . . We reject and condemn the US Administration s unlawful statement regarding the status of Al Quds . . . Just like the fact that Israel s decision to annex Al Quds and its actions and practices therewith are never accepted, we declare that this statement is identically null and void from the point of view of conscience, justice and history. We invite all members of the UN, the EU and the international community to remain committed to the status of Al Quds and all related UN Resolutions. Rather than accomplishing anything much at all, the extraordinary OIC meeting primarily served to heighten Tayyip  Erdo an s prestige, at home as well as abroad. As such, a cynic would say that Trump s timing was impeccable, as 17/25 December marks the anniversary of the scandal variously known as #AKPgate that erupted in 2013, and that presently was very much on people s minds in Turkey given that the Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab (or R za Sarraf, in Turkish) was appearing in court in New York. The court case investigates breaches of the sanctions placed upon Iran and many Turks eagerly followed the proceedings on Twitter. One Istanbul-based writer Kareem Shaheen described the accusations as follows:  [i]n a case that has strained relations between Turkey and the US, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed Iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme. He told jurors in New York on Thursday [30 November 2017] that [Tayyip] Erdo an, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time, had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of Iran. Zarrab said he had [also] bribed the then Turkish economy minister Zafer  a layan and the former head of the state-owned Halkbank. As a result, given that the Zarrab case all but exacerbated the dire Turco-American relationship, Trump s Jerusalem declaration must have come as a welcome bolt from the blue for Erdogan. The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s capital finally absolved the Erdogan from any attempts to salvage the cross-Atlantic relationship, and instead emboldened him to announce publicly that the Republic of Turkey is now the rightful heir to the Ottoman Empire and the only hope left for Muslims across the world, Muslims that have been victimised by years and years of oppressive U.S. foreign policy. And, putting a cherry on top of the proverbial cake of discontent, Erdo an announced on Thursday, 17 December 2017, that he would establish a Turkish Embassy in Jerusalem, representing Ankara in Palestine, to be clear. Speaking to an audience of faithful followers in the city of Karaman, the Prez declared  God willing, the day is close when officially, with God s permission, we will open our embassy there,  in Jerusalem.All the while, the Palestinian people continue to suffer and Israel employs any and every pretext available to stage military assaults on the Gaza strip and crack down on Palestinian protesters But, Trump has done his deed, leaving his indelible mark on the Middle East, while the Prez, in turn, can now rightfully claim that he alone is able to represent the Muslim world on the international arena.*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent scholar who was living in Istanbul for some time, with a wide interest in the politics, history and culture of the Balkans and the Greater Middle East.

Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias push towards Idlib province,"AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias backed by Russian air power stepped up a military campaign against rebels in eastern Hama province in a push towards the rebel stronghold of Idlib province in northwestern Syria, rebels and witnesses said.  They said dozens of aerial strikes believed to be conducted mainly by Russian jets in the last 48 hours hit opposition held villages and towns in the northeastern Hama countryside and the southern part of Idlib province.  The Islamist Hayat Tahrir al Sham and some Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel faction in control of these areas said they were sending reinforcements to seize back a string of villages in the northeastern Hama countryside, near the town of Rihjan, that the army had earlier announced were captured in heavy fighting. The army said the villages of Um Turayka, Bilil, and Rujum al Ahmar were seized, forcing the rebels to flee to areas close to the administrative boundaries of Idlib province.  The Syrian army had lost the strategically located Idlib province to insurgents when the provincial capital fell to rebels in 2015. It has since become the only province that is fully under opposition control. The Syrian army s first goal was to retake strategic Abu al Dhour military airport, one of the largest airports in the north of the country that fell to rebels in 2015. It was heavily bombed on Sunday, a rebel source said.  The regime movements seek to besiege Idlib province with the help of Shi ite militias fighting with them,  said Colonel Mustafa Bakour, a commander in the Jaish al Izza rebel faction.    Tahrir al Sham, which is spearheaded by the former al Qaeda branch in Syria, is the main rebel force in the province, raising fears among civilians and rebels alike that Moscow and the Syrian army and its allies would soon turn it into a major battlefield. The strategically located province that borders Turkey is part of the Russian-led de-escalation zones that seek to shore up ceasefires in western Syria. Idlib has been a haven for tens of thousands of rebels and civilians who were forced to abandon their homes in other parts of western Syria that the government and its foreign military allies have recaptured from rebels. It has already been the target of intensive strikes by the Russia and Syrian air forces in the past year that have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed hospitals and civil defense centers. Tahrir al Sham also repelled simultaneously an offensive by Islamic State militants who have been for the last few weeks pushing into the opposition-controlled territory to extend a small enclave they have in that area, among the few they retain across Syria.  The ultra hardline militants also seized a string of villages that brought them within kilometers of Idlib province.  The Russian and Syrian army advance towards Idlib is also piling pressure on Turkey which had since October begun a major military deployment in the province it considers within its sphere of influence.  Ankara s intervention seeks to rein in Russian strikes and prevent Idlib from facing a similar fate to Mosul or Aleppo, according to a senior rebel commander briefed on Turkish policy.

 WATCH Trump Absolutely CRUSH His Wife In Viral Video Clip From Inauguration,"Many people have long suspected that Trump is abusive, if for no other reason than he s outwardly abusive to so many people. His Twitter feed alone is rife with abuse. He seems to take pleasure in hurting people, and that appears to include his family, because abusers abuse everyone in one form or another.During his inauguration, as he stood facing Melania, he apparently said something extremely hurtful to her. She s smiling and, if you look at his cheeks, he seems to be smiling too, and then suddenly, his smile disappears and he turns pointedly away from her. You can see from the change in her expression that whatever he said just crushed her.Watch below:Wouldn t he want the world to see how happy the two of them are, even if it is a fa ade? What could she have possibly done to warrant this, anyway? Say she really did do something worthy of rebuke   he could have, and should have, waited until they were alone to say something to her. The way he did it wasn t just crushing to her, it was probably also humiliating for her.That wasn t the only time he was demeaning, either. When he greeted the Obamas prior to his inauguration, he left her behind in the car, and then left her behind again to walk into the White House. It was President Obama and Michelle who actually escorted Melania inside.But that s where Trump gets satisfaction   in shaming and humiliating people as much as possible for even the slightest transgressions. Typical emotionally abusive behavior. Some may say she knew what she was getting into when she got involved with him, but that s victim-blaming, and it comes from those who don t get it.It s extremely unlikely Melania deserved whatever he said to her, or his self-satisfied, deliberately supercilious manner when he turned his back on her.Featured image by Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images",News,"January 24, 2017",0

 ‘Family Values’ Republican Busted For Having A Sex Video Of Himself On Government Computer,"He s a Republican. He s anti-gay. He s all about  family values.  So of course he just got busted for having a sex video of himself on his work computer.Nebraska GOP state Senator Bill Kintner is being urged to resign by Republican Governor Pete Ricketts after the Nebraska State Patrol discovered a sexually explicit video of Kintner on the government computer he uses for work.According to the Lincoln Journal Star,A source familiar with the situation said Kintner told investigators about the video when he asked the Nebraska State Patrol for help with computer problems in July 2015.The patrol confirmed Friday that Kintner had sought help for  what he believed to be a potential internet scam that occurred while the senator was in Massachusetts using his state computer. Having such a video on his work computer is a violation of Nebraska law, but it appears that Governor Ricketts and Kintner both ignored the law and hid the investigation from the public since last November when the discovery of the video was made.Only on Friday did Ricketts actually publicly call for Kintner to resign. Due to the ongoing investigation of this issue, I have been unable to say anything publicly. If the allegations are true, Senator Kintner needs to resign. The violation and the cover-up has Democrats calling for more than just Kintner s resignation. It is not enough for Sen. Kintner to resign in shame. Anyone that knew this information and continued to let him sit in office must also resign,  Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said in a statement.  Did Gov. Ricketts or his staff look the other way so they had (Kintner s) vote in the Unicameral? This is so serious, in fact, that the State Patrol has turned out their findings to the Accountability and Disclosure Commission and and ethics investigation is underway.This is also incredibly hypocritical considering Kintner constantly brags about being a conservative  Christian  who has urged Christian-owned businesses to provide gay customers bad service on purpose and once told the Journal Star that his parents  taught me the moral absolutes of Christianity, and I just applied those to everything. Except himself, apparently.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"July 30, 2016",0
UK lawmakers vent anger at PM May's fragile government over welfare reform,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lawmakers from Britain s ruling Conservative Party vented their anger on Wednesday against Prime Minister Theresa May s pursuit of welfare reforms, reinforcing doubts about her authority over a party divided by Brexit.  Several members of May s party spoke out against the government during a symbolic debate in parliament by demanding changes or even an outright halt to the implementation of a new welfare payment system which has been dogged by design problems. May leads a minority government, propped up by a small Northern Irish party, faced with the task of delivering a smooth departure from the European Union - something which requires a deeply split parliament to approve large amounts of new legislation. The opposition Labour Party won a symbolic vote on a motion calling for the welfare plan to be paused, but May s party avoided a full blown public rebellion by ordering its lawmakers to abstain, thereby masking the extent of internal unrest.  The Labour motion passed by 299 votes to zero with one Conservative rebel, but does not force the government to act.    Nevertheless, Conservative lawmakers openly criticized the government s approach and demanded changes during the debate  Why are we undermining a policy with the potential to change lives for the better by not addressing a fundamental flaw at its heart?  said Sarah Wollaston, the only Conservative lawmaker to formally vote against the government s orders. The defeat comes as ahead of debates on Brexit legislation, which had been expected to start this week but have yet to be scheduled. Ministers are sifting through hundreds of proposed changes, some of which are backed by enough Conservative lawmakers to inflict a more damaging defeat on May s government.  Labour, which wants to topple May s government and take control of the troubled Brexit process, had urged Conservative lawmakers to rebel on the welfare vote and later called the tactical abstention a sign of the government s weakness.  Yet again the prime minister and the Tories (Conservatives) cannot command a majority in the House of Commons. The prime minister is in office but not in power,  said Labour s welfare spokeswoman Debbie Abrahams after the vote. Welfare minister David Gauke accused the Labour Party of trying to wreck the reforms and vowed to listen to lawmakers  concerns but proceed with the policy. The welfare reform, known as  Universal Credit , is designed to simplify payments to claimants by consolidating six different types of state benefits into one.  The policy was first implemented for a small number of claimants in 2013 under May s predecessor David Cameron, but the expansion of the program to more people has been beset by long delays and criticism that it risks harming vulnerable citizens. The government is pressing ahead with the latest phase of the program despite concerns voiced by lawmakers from all parties that claimants must wait six weeks for payment. The government says they have taken measures to stop this happening. ",worldnews,"October 18, 2017 ",1
"Losing immunity, German anti-immigrant party's co-head may face perjury charge","BERLIN (Reuters) - A regional parliament has lifted the immunity of the best known politician in the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, opening the way for prosecutors to pursue possible perjury charges against her. Frauke Petry, who is the AfD s co-chairwoman, has been dogged by allegations that she lied under oath to a committee of the Saxony parliament about how the party s campaign for the 2014 election in the state was financed. The ending of her immunity from prosecution adds to the right-wing party s problems less than four weeks before a national election. Weakened by infighting, it has bled support over the last year as voters  concerns about immigration have eased. Prosecutors have pursued the case against Petry, who denies the allegations, for more than a year. Her immunity as a member of the Saxony s parliament ended at midnight, a spokesman for the assembly said. A spokesman for prosecutors in the state capital Dresden said they would await written confirmation of that from the parliament s president before any further proceedings could be agreed upon. The AfD is polling between 7 and 10 percent in opinion surveys - well down from a high of 15.5 percent at the end of 2016 but still clearing the 5-percent threshold needed to enter the federal parliament in the Sept. 24 national election. Petry cuts an increasingly isolated figure in the AfD, which she transformed from an anti-euro party at its founding in 2013 into a group that taps into voters  concerns about migration. The party soared in the polls after Chancellor Angela Merkel s decision in 2015 to open Germany s borders to migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond, of whom more than a million have since arrived. At a party conference in April, Petry suffered a humiliating defeat when delegates refused to discuss her plan to shift the party towards the mainstream. ",worldnews,"August 29, 2017 ",1
UCLA basketball players arrested in China ahead of Trump's visit: reports,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Three UCLA men s basketball players were arrested in China for shoplifting on Tuesday, media said, a day before U.S. President Donald Trump arrived on his first official visit. The players arrested were freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, according to USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and ESPN, all of which cited unnamed sources familiar with the incident. Ball is the younger brother of National Basketball Association rookie Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers. Reached by telephone at a hotel in the eastern city of Hangzhou on Wednesday, Ball declined to comment. ESPN said the three had been picked up by police at their hotel on Tuesday  and released on bail early on Wednesday. They were confined to their hotel pending legal proceedings, it said. The University of California, Los Angeles, declined to confirm the arrests but said it was  aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China .  The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time,  UCLA Athletics said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Shana Wilson. The UCLA team had arrived in China on Sunday with plans to play Georgia Tech in both teams  regular-season opener on Saturday, according to statements from both teams. It traveled to Hangzhou, about three hours by bus from Shanghai, to visit the campus of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), sponsor of the annual Pac-12 games in China. The three players were questioned about stealing from a Louis Vuitton store next to the hotel where the team is staying, ESPN said. UCLA representatives, including coach Steve Alford, were at the police station while they were there, it said, citing an unidentified source. Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement the conference was  disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about.   Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation,  he said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday the Chinese government had reported the case to the U.S. side in accordance with consular agreements.  China is handling this case in accordance with the law and will guarantee the lawful rights in accordance with the law of those involved in this case,  she said. In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday by Arash Markazi, a senior writer at ESPN, LaVar Ball said his son, LiAngelo, would be fine.  He ll be fine. Everyone s making it a big deal. It ain t that big a deal,  said Ball, the outspoken CEO of athletic apparel maker Big Baller Brand. Chinese President Xi Jinping led Trump on a private tour of the Forbidden City to kick off his visit on Wednesday. White House officials could not be immediately reached for  comment. Alibaba declined to comment, as did the Hangzhou police. A U.S. State Department official said the department was aware of reports of three citizens arrested in China and stood ready to provide assistance but had no further comment due to privacy considerations. Three players from Georgia Tech were questioned by the authorities in China on Tuesday at their hotel in Hangzhou but were later released by police, Georgia Tech athletics spokesman Mike Flynn said in a statement.  During the questioning, it was determined that Georgia Tech student-athletes were not involved in the activities being investigated. They have resumed their scheduled activities,  Flynn said.

LOL! Lifetime Politician Who Got 2% Support From Voters In GOP Primaries Tells CBS: “I don’t know what ‘America First’ Means” [VIDEO],"Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican was unable to differentiate himself from other GOP Presidential candidates and in August 2015, national polls said that 13 percent of Republican or leans-Republican voters said they d never vote for him.

Putin says he doubts Trump met with Moscow prostitutes,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday he doubted U.S. President-elect Donald Trump had met with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room several years ago, referring to an unverified dossier published last week that Trump has dismissed as “fake news”. “Trump arrived and straight away rushed to meet with Moscow prostitutes. This is an adult man and, apart from that, is a man who for many years took part in organizing beauty contests. He has socialized with the most beautiful women in the world,” Putin said in response to a question from a reporter from pro-Kremlin news agency Life about whether he had seen files or videos suggesting Trump had met with prostitutes. “I find it difficult to believe that he ran to a hotel to meet with our girls of reduced social responsibility,” Putin said at a news conference in Moscow with Moldova’s President Igor Dodon. Trump, a New York businessman who will be inaugurated as U.S. president on Friday, has dismissed reports that Russia had compromising information on him as “fake news” and “phony stuff.”  Reuters has not independently verified the claims contained in the dossier. The information was summarized in a U.S. intelligence report presented to Trump and President Barack Obama this month. James Clapper, director of national intelligence, has said the dossier was not produced by U.S. intelligence agencies and they have not judged whether the information is reliable. Putin said it was “total nonsense” that Russian intelligence had followed Trump to gather compromising material on him and reiterated that he had never met Trump.  “Trump, when he came to Moscow, and I can’t even remember when that was, ... he wasn’t any sort of political figure. We didn’t even know about his political ambitions,” Putin said. “What, someone thinks the special services chase after every American billionaire? Of course not, that’s total nonsense.” ",politicsNews,"January 17, 2017 ",1
"WHITE WASHED? Trump Claims Classified JFK Files Will Be Released, Reigniting Conspiracy Suspicions","Shawn Helton  21st Century Wire JFK FILES    Conspiracy still shrouds the JFK assassination. (Photo Illustration Shawn Helton)The assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, is one of the most infamous crimes of the 20th century. Like the enigmatic attacks of 9/11, it was an act that will forever be shrouded in conspiracy, intrigue and mystery   despite the lone gunman theory implicating Lee Harvey Oswald.New reports indicate that classified documents pertaining to the assassination of the 35th US President will be allowed to be released by US President Donald Trump.The NY Times reports: The release of the information being held in secret at the National Archives   including several thousand never-before-seen documents   was mandated to occur by Oct. 26 under a 1992 law that sought to quell conspiracy theories about the assassination.Mr. Trump has the power to block the release of the documents, and intelligence agencies have pressured him to do so for at least some of them. The agencies are concerned that information contained in some of the documents could damage national security interests.In a statement to reporters, the White House left open the possibility that Mr. Trump might halt the release of some documents. While word of a possible release of never-before-seen JFK files has spread like wildfire throughout mainstream media and alternative media alike, one should remain skeptical and cautious, as the likelihood of the military industrial complex, the CIA and other clandestine agencies releasing any conclusive inter-agency conspiracy related details about the JFK assassination   is next to zero.The globalist Deep State machine that has ruled the US and the world since WWII would have too much to lose if anything larger came out of America s most infamous conspiracy. It would be like opening Pandora s box. (Image Source: circololettori.it)Here s one theory in the mystery surrounding JFK s assassination that includes some uncanny historical and Hollywood associations that we are not likely to hear about In 1980, after a six-hour  suicidal  standoff with police, a contract killer linked to organized crime named Charles Harrelson, admitted to killing US District Judge John H Wood, and in the process, while apparently  high on cocaine  also claimed to have been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.The father of Hollywood star Woody Harrelson was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named Sam Degelia Jr in 1968 and in 1981, Charles received two life sentences for the murder of John Wood.Throughout 1981, more questions materialized regarding the assassination of Judge Wood in a UPI article: Defense lawyers maintained [Charles] Harrelson was framed by police and the informant. Charles an ex-felon, said a friend, Hampton Robinson III, who failed to show up to testify, had driven the car. He suggested someone, possibly federal agents, had planted the guns so he could be arrested. He denied telling [Department of Public Safety agent] Pagel he carried a gun.   THREE TRAMPS    Charles Harrelson (ID d by forensic experts on the left) is believed to be one of three arrested in Dealey Plaza after JFK s assassination in 1963. (Image Source: jfkmurdersolved)When considering the Harrelson-Kennedy connection, the 1989 book Crossfire comes to mind.Crossfire, written by the recently deceased well-known researcher Jim Marrs, was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful Oliver Stone film JFK. Below is a passage from Crossfire, as it relates to the apparent Harrelson-Kennedy link: Aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire, Harrelson   the father of actor Woody Harrelson   had a long history of involvement with Dallas underworld characters linked directly to Jack Ruby. Continuing, the Crossfire also stated: The late Fort Worth graphics expert Jack White, who testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, already had noticed the resemblance of Harrelson to the youngest tramp. In a 1981 interview with Chuck Cook, Harrelson claimed to have the  biggest story  the reporter would ever have, when questioned about Kennedy s death. Additionally, Jo Ann Harrelson noted the  similarities  between the tramp photos and her husband. All this coupled with the fact Diane Lou Oswald (the mother of Woody Harrelson), who had also been married to Charles Harrelson in Midland, Texas, made for a strange background concerning the JFK saga.In a KDFW-TV interview in 1982 below, Charles Harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing Kennedy   but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the US government s involvement in the death of Kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in America.The interview is a startling revelation, adding to the enigmatic JFK mystery and in the process   provides another strange backdrop to a captivating case . 21st Century Wire says Today, President Donald Trump announced he plans to release the tens of thousands of classified documents on the assassination of President John F Kennedy held at the National Archives and Records Administration. The president believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise,  a White House official told Reuters. Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,  Trump tweeted on Saturday.Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017Days before Trump s announcement, The Washington Post claim that their National Security Council source told deep state media oracle that federal government agencies have warned the president not to release some of the documents for fear they could somehow comprise  national security , although this rationale is hard to justify as the event took place nearly 55 years ago   unless of course, some legacy parties still in power today were implicated in the remaining documents.It s difficult to know if Trump is referring to all of the remaining CIA and FBI documents, or just some of them, or whether or not these documents will be redacted (presumably to protect any important names involved in the JFK murder, or possible cover-up). However, Trump appears to have left open the possibility that if government agencies feel the documents should not to released, then he would heed their advice. Trump added that his decision was  subject to the receipt of further information. According to Phil Shenon, a professional researcher and author on the Warren Commission: It s great news that the president is focused on this and that he s trying to demonstrate transparency. But the question remains whether he will open the library in full   every word in every document, as the law requires,  Shenon said.  And my understanding is that he won t without infuriating people at the CIA and elsewhere who are determined to keep at least some of the information secret, especially in documents created in the 1990s. The scheduled date of the release is meant to be on October 26, 2017.STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATESREAD MORE JFK NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire JFK FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 21, 2017",0

Boat carrying asylum seekers from Myanmar capsizes off Bangladesh,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - At least two people have died after a boat carrying refugees fleeing Myanmar capsized on its way to Bangladesh on Sunday, local authorities told Reuters. The boat sank near Shah Porir Dwip, on the southern tip of Bangladesh, said Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam, the local commander of Border Guard Bangladesh. He confirmed via SMS that the bodies of a boy and an elderly woman had been recovered in the water while eight others had been rescued. The rescue operation was ongoing on early Monday morning, local time, and the number of missing unknown, he said. More than 500,000 ethnic Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when an attack by Rohingya militants on police and military posts in Rakhine State sparked a ferocious response from Myanmar s security forces which the United Nations described as  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar s government denies the allegations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled as terrorists the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks. Six weeks after the violence erupted, Rohingya continue to stream into neighboring Bangladesh by land and sea amid reports that Myanmar s military and Buddhist mobs have targeted Rohingyas with summary killings and burned villages. Myanmar, a mostly Buddhist nation, does not recognize the Rohingya Muslims as citizens, even though many have lived in Rakhine for generations. After waves of violence in the past five years, about 1 million Rohingya have been forced to move to Bangladesh. The overturned vessel is the latest of a series of deadly mishaps at sea involving Rohingya refugees. Most recently, on Sept. 28, a boat carrying about 80 refugees overturned. Seventeen survived, while 23 were confirmed dead and the remainder declared missing. On Sept. 6, 46 bodies were recovered after another boat sunk in the narrow stretch of water that separates Myanmar and Bangladesh. Among the dead were 19 children, 18 women and 9 men.

 Man Who Said There Was No Recession DURING The Great Recession Is Rumored For Top Economic Post,"Reports are surfacing that CNBC s Larry Kudlow is on the short list of candidates for chairman the Council of Economic Advisers, which is the government s top economic policy group. Kudlow isn t just an advocate of the failed trickle-down theory of economics, he also claimed, back in 2007, that no recession was coming. As we all know, 2008 proved him dead wrong, and now Trump wants him in a top economic position.According to Craig Harrington, Director of the Economic Policy Program at Media Matters for America, this is how bad Kudlow is: According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), an award-winning nonprofit research organization that is perhaps best-known for determining a chronology of American business cycles and recessions, the Great Recession began in December 2007. Yet Kudlow published blogs on December 5, 6, and 7 of that year titled  The Recession Debate Is Over,   There Ain t No Recession,  and  Bush Boom Continues,  in the conservative National Review. By July 2008, as the unemployment rate continued to balloon in the seventh month of recession, Kudlow was still arguing in National Review that there was no recession or housing crisis. In  The Recession Debate Is Over, Kudlow claimed that the jobs numbers and business profits added up to no recession at all. In  There Ain t No Recession,  he doubled down on all of that, and in  Bush Boom Continues,  he actually said:That last one was published on Dec. 7, 2007. Eight months earlier, we began to see serious signs of an economic crahs with New Century Financial Corp., a major subprime lender, filing for bankruptcy. Unemployment began rising in Dec. 2007, and the Fed lowered short-term interest rates for the fifth time in four months.Kudlow didn t see any of that. He was focused entirely on the November jobs reports and business profits. He totally ignored other economic indicators. He s almost as bad as those who look only at the stock market for an idea of how our economy is doing.Moving on from Kudlow s absurdly incorrect predictions, in Feb. 2008, President Bush signed the first economic stimulus package into law, and then in March, the financial industry began crashing with the collapse of Bear Stearns. In April 2008, the Fed reduced interest rates yet again, and then in September, Lehmann Brothers collapsed.We all remember the chaos of the rest of 2008.This is more than simply putting someone who will work hard to make the rich richer and the poor poorer into an economic advisory position. This is someone whose economic experience and ideas are so far off that he couldn t, or wouldn t, see a recession coming despite the housing bubble collapse beginning in late 2006.Most economists worth their salt could see that foreshadowed the Great Recession, and knew that the Great Recession began at the end of 2007 (although Trump was  excited  for the housing crash because it meant more money for him).However, what can we expect from a president-elect who seems to see the presidency as just another reality show? Kudlow has published no scholarly papers on economics, and has no degree in economics at all, so he s not exactly qualified for the top economic position in our government.He plays an economist on television, though, and that s enough for Trump. Many of his cabinet picks seem to say that he has to know people from television in order to consider them for his cabinet. Kudlow is just another possibility that shows Trump has no idea what he s doing and thinks this is just another reality show.Featured image by Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0 via Flickr ",News,"December 16, 2016",0

"Arabs, Europe, U.N. reject Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital","LONDON (Reuters) - Arabs and Muslims across the Middle East on Wednesday condemned the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital as an incendiary move in a volatile region and Palestinians said Washington was abandoning its leading role as a peace mediator. The European Union and United Nations also voiced alarm at U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and its repercussions for any chances of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. Major U.S. allies came out against Trump s reversal of decades of U.S. and broad international policy on Jerusalem. France rejected the  unilateral  decision while appealing for calm in the region. Britain said the move would not help  peace efforts and Jerusalem should ultimately be shared by Israel and a future Palestinian state. Germany said Jerusalem s status could only be resolved on the basis of a two-state solution. Israel, by contrast, applauded Trump s move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message that it was  an important step towards peace  and it was  our goal from Israel s first day . He added that any peace accord with the Palestinians would have to include Jerusalem as Israel s capital and he urged other countries to follow Trump s example. [L8N1O660O] Trump upended decades of U.S. policy in defiance of warnings from around the world that the gesture risks aggravating conflict in the tinderbox Middle East. The status of Jerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. Its eastern sector was captured by Israel in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of an independent state they seek. Israel deems Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital dating to antiquity, and its status is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in a pre-recorded speech, said Jerusalem was the  eternal capital of the State of Palestine  and that Trump s move was  tantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator.  The last round of U.S.-brokered talks foundered in 2014 over issues including Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and Israeli accusations of Palestinian incitement to violence and refusal to recognise it as a Jewish state. The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which has dominated Gaza since soon after Israel ended a 38-year occupation in 2005, said Trump had committed a  flagrant aggression against the Palestinian people . Hamas urged Arabs and Muslims to  undermine U.S. interests in the region  and to  shun Israel . Protests broke out in parts of Jordan s capital Amman inhabited by Palestinian refugees, with youths chanting anti-American slogans. In the Baqaa refugee camp on Amman s outskirts, hundreds roamed the streets denouncing Trump and urging Jordan to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel.  Down with America...America is the mother of terror,  they chanted. Angry Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus  traditional birthplace in the West Bank town of Bethlehem and in Ramallah. A tree adorned with lights outside Bethlehem s Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born, and another in Ramallah, next to the grave of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were plunged into darkness. All Palestinian factions called for a general strike and protest rallies at midday on Thursday. The Saudi Royal Court issued a statement saying that the kingdom followed  with deep sorrow  Trump s decision and warned of  dangerous consequences of moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem . The statement described the move as   a big step back in efforts to advance the peace process , and urged the U.S. administration to reverse its decision and adhere to international will.  Egypt, which forged the first Arab peace deal with Israel in 1979, brushed off Trump s decision and said it did not change Jerusalem s disputed legal status. Jordan said Trump s action was  legally null  because it consolidated Israel s occupation of East Jerusalem. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said Trump s Jerusalem decision was dangerous and threatened the credibility of the United States as a broker of Middle East peace. He said the move would put back the peace process by decades and threatened regional stability and perhaps global stability. Qatar s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said Trump s undertaking was a  death sentence for all who seek peace  and called it  a dangerous escalation . Turkey said Trump s move was  irresponsible .   We call upon the U.S. Administration to reconsider this faulty decision which may result in highly negative outcomes and to avoid uncalculated steps that will harm the multicultural identity and historical status of Jerusalem,  the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. A few hundred protesters gathered outside the U.S. consulate in Istanbul, a Reuters cameraman at the scene said. The protest was largely peaceful, though some of the demonstrators threw coins and other objects at the consulate. Iran  seriously condemns  Trump s move as it violates U.N. resolutions on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, state media reported. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said earlier in the day that the United States was trying to destabilize the region and start a war to protect Israel s security.  In Southeast Asia, the leaders of Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia denounced Trump s action.  This can rock global security and stability,  Indonesian President Joko Widodo, leader of the world s largest Muslim-majority nation, told a news conference in which he called for the United States to reconsider its decision. British Prime Minister Theresa May disagreed with Trump s embrace of Jerusalem as Israel s capital before a final-status agreement as this was unlikely to help nurture peace in the region, her spokesman said. However, May s spokesman welcomed Trump s stated wish to end the conflict and his acknowledgement that the final status of Jerusalem, including boundaries within the city, must be subject to negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. French President Emmanuel Macron said he did not support Trump s  unilateral  move.   The status of Jerusalem is a question of international security that concerns the entire international community. The status of Jerusalem must be determined by Israelis and Palestinians in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations,  Macron told reporters in Algiers.  France and Europe are attached to a two-state solution - Israel and Palestine - living side by side in peace and security within recognised international borders with Jerusalem the capital of both states,  he said.  For now, I urge for calm and for everyone to be responsible. We must avoid at all costs avoid violence and foster dialogue,  he said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there was no alternative to a two-state solution and Jerusalem was a final-status matter only to be settled through direct talks.  I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,  Guterres said.  I will do everything in my power to support the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to return to meaningful negotiations.  ",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",1
Saudi Arabia says it dismantles Islamic State cell in Riyadh,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it had dismantled an Islamic State cell in the capital Riyadh, in connection with a plot to launch a suicide attack on the defense ministry. Two militants were killed and five others arrested in raids on three locations on Wednesday, an official source in the newly-created Presidency of State Security said in a statement on state-run television. Deadly bombing and shooting attacks have been mounted by Islamic State militants against security forces and Shi ite Muslims in Saudi Arabia. Islamic State has for years criticized the leadership of the Western-allied kingdom, the world s top oil exporter, accusing it of deviating from their strict interpretation of Islam and advancing the interests of their U.S. enemies. Thursday s statement said a suicide bomber in the eastern Riyadh district of al-Rimal detonated his vest after security forces surrounded a house used to manufacture suicide vests and explosives. Another militant was killed by security forces after he holed up with firearms in an apartment in the western district of al-Namar, it said.  The third raid was at a horse stable in the southern Riyadh suburb of al-Ghanamia which the statement said had been used as a headquarters. Security forces seized firearms and bomb-making materials, shown on state television along with a burned out car and a damaged building where the first militant had blown himself up. The suspects were not identified. Security forces closed off several areas in Riyadh on Wednesday, and videos shared online showed a plume of smoke rising at one location. The plot to attack the defense ministry, uncovered last month, allegedly involved two Yemeni nationals and two Saudi citizens. A Saudi security source said at the time that one of the detainees was a member of the armed Houthi movement, which is locked in a 2-1/2-year-old war with a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.

Covering Mugabe for Reuters - 'You're the one who says I'm dying?',"HARARE (Reuters) - Retired correspondent Cris Chinaka worked for Reuters in Harare from 1990 to 2015. Before that he reported on Zimbabwe for the ZIANA news agency and MOTO, a weekly newspaper. Here he reflects on a third of a century of covering  Uncle Bob . There are two images of Robert Gabriel Mugabe that jump out of my memory to illustrate the contrasting sides of the man who led Zimbabwe for 37 years. The first is of a combative and ebullient 57-year-old, dressed in an olive green military-type suit in the dying days of what was then white-run Rhodesia. Waving a clenched fist in the air, he was scolding his opponents and rallying his supporters as they marched confidently towards the birth of a new nation: Zimbabwe. The second is of a shrunken 93-year-old slumped in a cushioned seat, snoozing. His wife Grace, more than 40 years his junior, whispers in his ear while placing a colorful cowboy hat on his head as thousands of fawning ZANU-PF party faithful applauded. In the nearly four decades that separated those two episodes, Zimbabwe had, in the eyes of its critics, declined into the same state as its leader: hollowed out, impotent and for some an object of ridicule. That first image is from my first meeting with Mugabe, in February 1980, at a ZANU-PF rally in the southeastern province of Masvingo, ahead of the vote that would mark independence from  Britain. As Mugabe was ushered off the stage by his security guards, I introduced myself, shook his hand and asked for an interview. He was warm and attentive at this approach from a junior reporter and said my newspaper, the MOTO weekly, was one of his favorite publications. Aside from its nationalist editorial line, the paper may also have appealed to the Jesuit-educated Mugabe as it was published by the Catholic Church to which he belonged. Shortly after our conversation, Mugabe survived what would be one of many assassination attempts when a land mine exploded,  narrowly missed his vehicle in the motorcade heading back to the capital, Harare. I had a longer one-on-one meeting three years later in March 1983 in India, where I was on a Commonwealth scholarship studying for a postgraduate degree in journalism. Mugabe prided himself on his elephantine and encyclopedic memory, but he must have been briefed on the backgrounds of the students at the Zimbabwean mission function in Delhi. When I introduced myself, he remarked,  Oh, you are our Roman Catholic man, right?  Five years later, when I was covering an official visit to Brussels for Zimbabwe s national news agency, Mugabe s chief of protocol told him:  Your Excellency, that young Roman Catholic man is now a father.  On the return journey, Mugabe came through from the presidential section of the plane into economy class, as he frequently did on such trips, to chat with members of the delegation. This time he sat next to me. He asked about my wife and our new baby daughter. We also discussed my job and current affairs. As he got up to leave after a 30-minute conversation, Mugabe said:  You sound like an intelligent young man. Why did you go into journalism?  Was he just joking, or was this a rare insight into what Mugabe - a man who would later be accused of gagging free speech and individual rights - really thought about the news business?  YOU RE THE ONE WHO SAYS I M DYING?  Mugabe knew the name of my daughter, Tariro, and for many years he would ask after her. I sometimes thought he remembered because she was born around the same time as his own daughter, Bona. On other foreign trips around Africa and Europe, I had opportunities for discussions with Mugabe, invariably about the subject of his mission, but I always got a sense that he was only giving away glimpses of his real thoughts and feelings. Even as his years advanced and his ability to recall distant facts and figures deserted him, he retained a sense of humor - especially at suggestions that he was on his way out. In 2010, having secured an interview for Reuters, I was ushered into his office and greeted him as he sat behind his desk. In return, he remarked with a smile:  Aargh, so you are the man who has been reporting that I am dying?  The interview lasted 90 minutes, and covered everything from his health, the desperate state of the economy and the Western sanctions that his ZANU-PF government blamed for the ills that had befallen the nation. My story focused on his denial that he was suffering from cancer and featured, for the first time, a line that he would repeat many times over the following years.  Jesus died once, and resurrected only once - and poor Mugabe several times,  he said, clapping his hands in glee. ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1
Trump criticizes GM for Mexico investments,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rebuked General Motors Co (GM.N) on Tuesday, widening his criticism of American companies that have invested in Mexico. Trump has made criticism of Ford Motor Co (F.N) a staple of his campaign speeches for more than a year, repeatedly suggesting that the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker would back down from plans to expand in Mexico or face a 35 percent tariff on vehicle exports. Trump also has criticized Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, which is owned by United Technologies Corp and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the owner of Nabisco, for shifting jobs to Mexico. “I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies – like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier – are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage,” Trump said in a statement defending his comments about a Mexican-American judge overseeing civil lawsuits against Trump University. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn criticism, including from within his own party.  A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Trump had decided to criticize GM. GM spokesman Jim Cain declined comment on Trump’s criticism. In December 2014, GM said it was investing $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 - a move that would allow it to double its production capacity at its plants around the country. GM said in 2014 the investment would create 5,600 jobs in Mexico. The Detroit News reported in May that GM plans next year to move some light-duty pickup production to the Flint Assembly Plant from Mexico, according to a memo from UAW Local 598 to membership. Mexican auto production has been rising in recent years as numerous automakers expand operations. Mexico produced 3.4 million vehicles in 2015, the seventh largest vehicle producer worldwide, and could surpass South Korea by 2020, producing more than 5 million vehicles, according to industry forecasts. Ford has repeatedly rejected Trump’s criticism and emphasized its significant U.S. investments and employment. In April, Ford announced it would invest $1.6 billion to build more small cars in Mexico. In 2015, Ford said it would invest $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission plants in Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1

Honduran vote count gives Hernandez 1 point lead over rival,"TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez extended the lead over his rival to just over one percentage point in a seesawing, delayed vote count for a presidential election that has sparked a political crisis, latest results showed on Thursday. The website of the electoral tribunal said that with 90.4 percent of ballots counted after Sunday s election, Hernandez had secured 42.68 percent of the vote in the Central American nation, with his centrist opponent Salvador Nasralla on 41.6 percent. The process has been disrupted by technical glitches, and Nasralla initially held a five point lead over pre-election favorite Hernandez until the count ground to a halt on Monday with more than half of the ballots counted. When the count restarted some 36 hours later, the results started to swing in favor of Hernandez, and Nasralla cried foul, rejecting the figures and saying that he was being robbed.

 Trump’s Meeting With Germany’s Angela Merkel Goes From Awkward To Offensive In Seconds (VIDEO),"A sit-down meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel went from painfully awkward to downright offensive when Trump couldn t even muster an ounce of humility and grace. During a photo op, the two world leaders sat in stony silence as photographers did their best to try to capture a picture that showed some warmth between what are supposed to be two close allies. Instead they got Trump looking like his dad just told him they wouldn t be getting ice cream after all and Merkel squirming in discomfort.Trump s obvious irritability was bizarre to begin with, but his refusal to interact with Merkel only got worse. When a reporter suggested the pair give a handshake (as is customary when two leaders meet for the first time), Merkel leaned over to Trump to ask if he wanted to give it a go only to have Trump continue to stare straight ahead, ignoring her. She stared in astonishment, then resignation. The realization that the President of the United States really is this pathetic was written all over her face.Photographers: Can we get a handshake?

His healthcare plan is going down in flames. His budget cuts   which focus primarily on stripping funding away from the elderly and children in favor of more military spending   are getting some of the worst press since his Muslim ban. His second Muslim ban was just shot down by two federal judges. And his plan to accuse the British government of helping Obama wiretap him didn t just blow up in his face, but actually caused an international scandal. Or it could be the fact that Germany has shown zero interest in indulging his tantrums.Whatever the cause, America just got another clear reminder that the damage Trump is doing isn t just domestic. He s undermining relationships with crucial allies in ways that may take decades to repair. And he s not even willing to give a simple handshake to prevent it.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 17, 2017",0
"Republicans propose to delay, pause Obamacare taxes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans proposed on Tuesday to delay or suspend several taxes under former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, including a tax on medical devices and the so-called “Cadillac” tax on generous health insurance plans. The move represents a new Republican attempt to roll back provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act widely known as Obamacare, after repeated failures by Congress’ majority party this year to repeal the law. Republicans in the House and Senate are also in the final stages of reconciling tax overhaul legislation, including a proposal to scrap Obamacare’s individual mandate, which imposes a tax penalty on Americans who do not obtain health insurance.  A spokeswoman for the House Ways and Means Committee said the additional proposed healthcare tax rollbacks would not be part of the broader tax overhaul bill. Republicans could try to merge the healthcare tax proposals with a must-pass government funding bill that is expected to be passed by Dec. 22, when current funding runs out. But to succeed, Republicans in the Senate, who hold a slim majority of seats, would need an assist from Democrats to get past procedural hurdles.  In a statement, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady announced five new Republican-sponsored bills to provide targeted relief from Obamacare taxes, saying he looked forward to “advancing legislation in the weeks ahead.” One proposed bill would retroactively eliminate Obamacare penalties for employers who did not offer health insurance to their employees over the last three years, as well as for next year. The bill would also delay for one year the Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance, which is otherwise scheduled to go into effect in 2020. Labor unions oppose this tax because their members often receive more generous healthcare plans, and they fear it would increase their costs. Another bill would suspend for five years the tax on medical devices, such as pacemakers and artificial hips. It was first imposed in January 2013 as a funding mechanism for Obamacare, a law that has brought medical coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans. The medical device tax has powerful opponents in both parties and manufacturers have lobbied heavily against it. Other proposals in the package would suspend a tax on health insurers for two years, and provide two years of relief from a tax on over-the-counter medications.

U.S. launches opioid fraud and detection unit,"(Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled on Wednesday a plan to go after doctors and pharmacies suspected of healthcare fraud by over-prescribing and unbridled distribution of addictive pain medications known as opioids. In a speech at a Columbus, Ohio, police academy, Sessions said a new Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit pilot program would also study death rates of patients with opioid prescriptions. “With these new resources, we will be better positioned to identify, prosecute and convict some of the individuals contributing to these tens of thousands of deaths a year,” Sessions said in prepared remarks. He said the new program would pay for 12 assistant U.S. attorneys serving three-year terms to investigate and prosecute fraud in the prescribing of opioids. Deaths from opioids have surged in the United States.  In 2015, prescription painkillers and heroin killed more than 33,000 people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly half of those overdoses involved prescription pain medications. Sessions has made a priority of fighting drug-related crimes since taking over the U.S. Justice Department in February. It shut down AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace accused of facilitating a global trade in drugs as well as firearms and computer hacking tools. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2017 ",1
Italy's government wins confidence votes on contested electoral law,"ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government on Wednesday won two confidence votes on a fiercely contested electoral law that is likely to penalize the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in next year s national election. The proposed voting system is backed by three of the country s four largest parties, with the centre-left government looking to rush it onto the statute books ahead of elections, which are due by May 2018.     Five-Star supporters protested in front of parliament as the Chamber of Deputies approved two confidence motions by a wide margin. A third such vote is scheduled for Thursday ahead of a final ballot in the lower house on the disputed bill.  Unlike the current rules, the new system would allow the formation of multi-party coalitions before the ballot, a factor likely to hurt 5-Star, which is topping most opinion polls and refuses to join alliances.  They want to take away our right to choose,  said Nicola Zuppa, 45, who said he had paid 175 euros ($200) to travel from Padua in northern Italy to take part in the protest, which drew up to 2,000 people in the heart of Rome. The use of multiple confidence motions allowed the ruling coalition to truncate discussion on the bill and sidestep dozens of planned secret votes on various amendments. The reform still needs the approval of the upper house Senate.  If you allow the electoral rules to be changed again so that the scum of the country rises to the top yet again, it will be your children who pay the price,  5-Star s founder Beppe Grillo wrote on his blog on Wednesday. President Sergio Mattarella, the only figure with the power to dissolve parliament, has called for new voting rules because the current system is very different for the upper and lower houses, meaning it could throw up conflicting majorities. All previous attempts to harmonize the rules have failed, most recently in June when dissident deputies used a secret vote to upend part of the proposed legislation. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi s Democratic Party (PD) drafted the latest version, which is supported by right-wing parliamentary rivals Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the Northern League. Five small parties are also backing the proposed law. Five-Star estimates that the new rules could cost it up to 50 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and potentially scupper its chances of being the largest group in parliament after the vote. Mattarella is expected to give the formation that gets the most seats the first crack at forming a government. The PD has denied trying to stymie the 5-Star s chances.  No one is preventing (5-Star) from making alliances if they want to,  said Ettore Rosato, the parliamentary party leader of the PD who has put his name to the reform.  If they don t want to do them, they can continue to be an isolated party.   Analysts say the new electoral system looks unlikely to throw up a clear parliamentary majority, with opinion polls showing the centre-left, centre-right and 5-Star splitting the vote three ways. Such a result could lead to the creation of a grand coalition that would need to span the political divide. ($1 = 0.8452 euros) ",worldnews,"October 11, 2017 ",1

 Poll Shows Hillary Leading Trump With This Surprising Demographic For The First Time Ever,"Until today, not one national poll had Clinton leading with male voters. Some have gotten close, but Donald Trump has always managed to lock it up. The gender gap that we have seen the last several elections was looking like a repeat for 2016.But now a new poll released the day of the third and final presidential debate shows Clinton now   for the first time   is leading with men. The newest poll from Bloomberg Politics shows Clinton edging out Trump by 2 points with men (46 to 44) and 9 points overall (47-38).The poll was conducted from October 14-17 with responses from 1,006 likely voters.So a week after the game-changing audio tape was leaked   in which Trump admits to sexually assaulting women   men have started to turn against the Republican nominee, and for good reason.Clinton is already gaining in Republican strongholds   white, college educated women, Cuban-Americans, young Republicans, Vietnamese-Americans, and now men. Such gains have turned traditionally red states like Arizona, Georgia and Texas into reachable victories for Democrats.With Trump under-performing Romney in key swing states (and red states), Trump cannot afford to lose his key voting demographics, but the damage from the tape and the accusations of sexual assault have hurt him tremendously.Republican men have distanced themselves from Trump after the revelations were leaked, invoking their wives and daughters and granddaughters as reasons they cannot support the GOP nominee. It s not clear if the shift in male support for Clinton comes from Independent or Republican defectors, but the numbers are slowly inching Clinton s way.With less than 20 days until election day, Trump is going to have to pivot hard if he hopes of bringing back all the defectors into his camp. With early voting already underway, in which millions have already cast their ballots, the window of opportunity may have passed.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",0

Opponents of Saudi 9/11 bill keep up fight ahead of veto override vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Opponents of a bill that would allow lawsuits against Saudi Arabia’s government over the Sept. 11 attacks kept up their fight against the measure on Tuesday, a day before the U.S. Senate is expected to oppose President Barack Obama’s veto, allowing the bill to become law. Opponents circulated a letter from Ash Carter, Obama’s Secretary of Defense, saying that the “Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,” known as JASTA, posed risks for U.S. forces abroad. “While we are sympathetic to the intent of JASTA, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the Department and its Service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad,” Carter wrote to Representative Mac Thornberry. As Reuters reported on Friday, Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has circulated a letter to his fellow House of Representatives Republicans saying that he will vote to sustain Obama’s veto and urging them to do the same. Obama vetoed the legislation on Friday. If Congress gets enough votes to override the veto for the first time since Obama became president in 2009 the bill would become law. It takes two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and House to override a veto.  The legislation passed the Senate and House without opposition, in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Riyadh, that the hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. While a few lawmakers have expressed concerns about the implications of the bill, it still has strong support, among both Republicans and Obama’s fellow Democrats. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, told reporters on Tuesday she would vote to override. She said the vote was about giving a day in court to survivors and relatives of victims of the 2001 attacks, not a rebuke of Obama. “It isn’t anti-president,” she said.

Exclusive: Pyongyang university to start fall classes without American staff after travel ban,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), North Korea s only western-funded university, will start the fall semester without its dozens of American staff after failing to secure exemptions to a U.S. travel ban that starts on Friday.  PUST - home to the largest concentration of foreigners in the reclusive state - plans to revise courses and teaching schedules but its largely English-based curriculum will be heavily impacted, two sources familiar with PUST s operations said. PUST was founded in 2010 by a Korean American evangelical Christian with the goal of helping North Korea's future elite learn the skills to modernize the isolated country and engage with the outside world. (Graphic: Americans detained in North Korea - tmsnrt.rs/2pmE3ks) In mid-July, however, the U.S. State Department announced a ban on Americans traveling to North Korea following the death earlier this year of an American student who had been detained by the state while on a tour. It advised U.S. citizens living there to leave. Since then, tensions on the Korean peninsula have escalated significantly. Nuclear-armed North Korea has undertaken a number of provocative missile tests, including two intercontinental ballistic missile launches and one medium-range missile test this week that flew over Japan. Of the roughly 130 foreigners at PUST including faculty members, staffers and family members, about 60 were U.S. citizens, one of the sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. None had received special permission to stay and all have now left Pyongyang.  The teaching activities and the unique  international English-based  character of the school are severely impacted by the U.S. travel ban and the decision of some other personnel not to return,  the source said.  The school, which is open about its Christian affiliation, has already been rocked by the detention of two of its staff members by the North Korean regime this year. The two were accused of acting against the interests of the state. U.S. officials announced the ban six weeks ago due to the risk Americans will be held for  long-term detention  in the country. The ban was imposed after U.S. student Otto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a tour last year.  Warmbier fell into a coma in custody and died soon after he was released to U.S. officials. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear. The last major tour involving U.S. tourists flew out of North Korea on Thursday. The ban, similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya, makes North Korea the only country in the world Americans are currently banned by the State Department from visiting. Journalists and humanitarian workers can apply for special permission. But the U.S. government has yet to issue guidelines on how to obtain waivers, leaving PUST and educators uncertain how or when it might be possible to apply for exemptions, according to the people familiar with PUST s operations. The State Department said it was unable to comment on specific requests for exemptions.  Over the past several weeks, PUST leaders have tried to lobby for exemptions so that their work can continue, the sources said. The school is involved in ongoing discussions with U.S. officials, they added. The university was seen as a rare experiment in academic diplomacy with a country increasingly entirely isolated from the rest of the world due to tightening sanctions over its defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons programs. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to stop Pyongyang achieving its goal of being able to fire a nuclear warhead to the United States and has warned the U.S. military is  locked and loaded  in case of North Korean provocation. Since PUST took in its first 50 students in 2010, the school has grown to about 500 undergraduate and 60 graduate students studying in mostly three departments - electronic and computer engineering, international finance and management and agriculture and life sciences.   A lot of effort has been spent over the past seven years that PUST has been operating. The prospect of this progress being undermined - even totally thwarted - as a consequence of the U.S. government action, is deeply worrying to everyone involved,  one of the sources said.

Zimbabwe's Mugabe defies expectations of immediate resignation,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe defied expectations he would resign on Sunday, pledging to preside over a ZANU-PF congress next month even though the ruling party had removed him as its leader hours earlier. ZANU-PF had given the 93-year-old less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto coup. Mugabe said in a address on state television that he acknowledged criticism against him from ZANU-PF, the military and the public, but did not comment on the possibility of standing down.

 Veteran’s Letter Thanking Bernie Sanders For Voting Against Iraq War Goes Viral (VIDEO),"A U.S. Marine s letter to Bernie Sanders that expressed the utmost gratitude for the Senator s position on not sending U.S. troops to Iraq has recently gone viral, and it s easy to see why.The letter surfaced on Tuesday morning, when Reddit user CharlieDarwinsFather created a post titled An open letter to Bernie Sanders from a Veteran of the Iraq War  in the subreddit SandersforPresident, where many of Sanders  supporters gather to share news about the Democratic presidential candidate. The letter s author had been based in North Carolina and had served in combat during the second battle of Fallujah in Iraq during 2005, 2006 and 2007.Having lived through those battles as a young adult and seeing the short and long-term effects that war had on his fellow marines, the author thanked the Vermont Senator with great sincerity for opposing the Iraq War, and said he wished that America had more politicians like Sanders who weren t afraid to fight for real peace. In his letter, the U.S. Marine wrote: Senator Sanders,I want to thank you. I want to thank you for exercising sound judgement even when everyone around you was beating the war drums.See I fought in the streets of Fallujah, Iraq. I saw more blood and death than any 19 year old ever should. The amount of friends I ve lost to war will likely be surpassed by the amount of friends I ve since lost to suicide.I know first hand the moral cost of war. One of the most painful truths that I must go through life with is that I fought in an unjust and unfounded war. While my intentions were good and I fought hard for the men to my left and to my right, and while I thought what I was doing what was right for the people of Iraq- I was wrong.You knew this. You knew this before we went to war and you fought, and you spoke truth to your peers and though your words largely fell on deaf ears, I am truly heartened to know that I now have a chance to vote for a man who exercised sound and moral judgement when the war drums were beating the loudest.I have a son. He is only one and a half years old but someday he will be 18 and I fear that if we continue to elect the same establishment politicians, he too will face the same decision that I did, and he too will go off to fight in an endless quagmire and that he too will come home, broken, and never fully returned or worse- never come home at all.So thank you, Senator Sanders, for being of sound mind and judgement. Thank you for being the only voice in this race that does not want to continue this legacy of warfare. Thank you for being the only voice that is and has been standing up for those of us that fought in these misguided wars. Thank you for giving me hope for a peaceful future. Sincerely, A U.S. Marine   0311 Operation Iraqi FreedomThe letter has gone viral, and it s easy to see why as Sanders  anti-establishment approach continues to win over Americans across the country. Now more than ever, we re becoming more aware of the affects that war has on our veterans, and just how common homelessness, suicide and mental illnesses like PTSD are.This letter is especially noteworthy because Sanders recently pointed out   during Monday s Democratic Town Hall on CNN   that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had supported the war while Sanders rallied against sending troops to Iraq because he was afraid it would create more power for extremists (which he was right about).Sanders has been passionate about preserving peace for a long time   as this video of Sanders giving a passionate speech in 2002 reveals:Sanders, who is the former Chairman and a current member of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee, continues to fight for America s veterans and has made it a crucial part of his campaign. This mission is spelled out right on Sanders  website: Sen. Sanders believes that just as planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war, so is taking care of the men and women who we sent off to fight the war. It includes caring for the spouses and children who have to rebuild their lives after the loss of a loved one. It includes caring for the hundreds of thousands of veterans with multiple amputations or loss of eyesight, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. It includes veterans who are having difficulty keeping jobs in order to pay their bills, and it includes the terrible tragedy of veterans committing suicide. And regardless of whether or not you think America should go to war, it s impossible to argue with Sanders when he says: While serious people can have legitimate differences about when our country should go to war, there should never be a debate whether we fulfill the promises made to the men and women who served this country in the military. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to provide the best quality care to those who have put their lives on the line to defend us. Featured image via Fort Rucker / Flickr",News,"January 27, 2016",0

"Republican U.S. health plan clears first hurdles, fate uncertain","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican plan backed by President Donald Trump to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system cleared its first hurdles in Congress on Thursday, but its chances for passage looked uncertain and top Republicans scrambled to bring disgruntled conservatives aboard. In the face of opposition by Democrats, healthcare providers and many conservatives, two House of Representatives committees approved the legislation that would undo much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, moving it closer to a vote before the full House. The Energy and Commerce Committee voted 31-23 along party lines, with Democrats unified against it, to back the plan after marathon proceedings lasting 27 straight hours. Hours earlier, the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee similarly voted 23-16 before dawn to approve it after working 17 straight hours. House Speaker Paul Ryan sought to bolster support among  conservatives in his own party, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said fellow Republicans must get in a “governing mode” while Trump denied the bill was in trouble. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” the Republican president said on Twitter. The bill would replace Obamacare’s income-based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market, while ditching the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor. It would also end penalties for not having insurance, though  insurers would be given permission to impose a 30 percent surcharge on customers who let their coverage lapse for more than two months and then seek to renew. Hospital stocks, which has fallen after the plan was unveiled on Monday, ended broadly higher on Thursday, with Tenet Healthcare up 3.4 percent. Shares of health insurers were mixed, with most large insurers modestly higher and Medicaid-focused insurers ending negative, including Molina Healthcare’s 3.3 percent drop.  While Republicans have been itching for seven years to dismantle Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement, the party has failed to coalesce behind the plan put forth by House Republican leaders. Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time in a decade, but passage of the legislation was not a foregone conclusion. Conservative lawmakers and lobbying groups have lambasted it as too similar to Obamacare. They have sharply criticized its proposed tax credits as an unacceptable new government entitlement program and have called for a quicker end to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. The measure is the first major legislative test for Trump and his fellow Republicans amid questions about whether they can govern effectively after years spent as an opposition party under Obama. Ryan, with his shirt sleeves rolled up and using a video screen with facts and figures, held what he called a “townhall-style” presentation for reporters on the proposal. But his intended audience appeared to be fellow Republicans, and he said his party must “actually make good on our word.” “The time is now,” said Ryan, who long has been the target of criticism of some conservatives. “This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare,” Ryan added. McConnell had a similar message, saying, “We need to get into a governing mode and start thinking about actually achieving something rather than just kind of sparring.” Democrats denounced the bill as a gift to the rich that would force millions of people off of insurance rolls. Republicans said it was needed to roll back the government’s “nanny state” role in the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system. “Trumpcare is a loser for just about all of America, unless you’re in the top 1 percent,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said. The House Budget Committee next Wednesday is due to merge the provisions approved by the two committees into one bill to be voted on by the full House before it goes to the Senate. Republican leaders are eyeing April for congressional passage of the bill. In a series of tweets early on Thursday, conservative Republican Senator Tom Cotton urged his House colleagues to pull back, saying their measure could not pass the Senate without major changes. “What matters in long run is better, more affordable health care for Americans, NOT House leaders’ arbitrary legislative calendar,” Cotton wrote. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer expressed confidence in the legislation’s prospects. “We’re not jamming this down people’s throat,” Spicer said. “This bill will land on the president’s desk. He will sign it. We will repeal Obamacare.” The Brookings Institution think tank forecast that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, expected early next week to release its closely watched assessment of the bill’s cost and coverage implications, would conclude that at least 15 million people would lose health insurance. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s earlier estimated 6-10 million people could lose health insurance coverage. Before the Energy and Commerce Committee vote, conservatives at the request of the panel’s chairman withdrew an amendment sponsored by Republican Joe Barton that would move up by two years, to next Jan. 1, the end of the Medicaid expansion. Barton said he planned to try to offer the amendment on the House floor. Committee Chairman Greg Walden hailed the unanimity of Republicans on the committee in approving the bill. Obamacare enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage. About half came from the Medicaid expansion. The bill’s proposed changes in Medicaid funding could hurt smaller, less diverse health insurers, Fitch Ratings said, and the unintended, unforeseen consequences of a bill this size are likely to create uncertainty for all health insurers.  With doctors, hospitals, seniors, health plans, Democrats, some governors and conservative Republicans against the bill, it may not make it out of the House, Mario Molina, chief executive of managed care company Molina Healthcare, said in an interview. “If it does, I think the Senate is going to slow things down and really take a good look,” Molina said. “We are going to have to hope that the Senate is more moderate.” ",politicsNews,"March 9, 2017 ",1

 Watch Out NRA: President Obama Is Coming For You,"Where Congress isn t acting on gun reform, President Obama is doing whatever he can. He knows that the ever-present epidemic of gun violence in the United States isn t going to go away on its own, and it s not going to go away by adding more and more guns to the mix either. Common sense actions need to be taken, and that s exactly what the president is offering   NRA be damned.The president wrote Friday in a Facebook post: Today, I want to update you on some important progress we ve made to protect our communities from gun violence. As I said in January, these commonsense steps are not going to prevent every tragedy, but what if they prevented even one? We should be doing everything we can to save lives and spare families the pain and unimaginable loss too many Americans have endured.First, we ve jumpstarted the development of smart gun technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. As long as we ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone, then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun. So, my Administration released a plan today to expedite the development of smart gun technology, including by identifying the requirements that smart guns would have to meet in order for law enforcement to purchase and use them effectively   and keep themselves and the public safer in the process.Second, we re doing more to make sure that those who are already prohibited from obtaining a firearm can t get their hands on one. Today, we re announcing a rule to ensure that federal mental health records about individuals prohibited from buying a gun are reported to the background check system.Third, the White House will convene state and local elected officials from all 50 states in May to discuss their efforts to prevent gun violence through legislative and executive actions. The goal is to figure out what works on the ground when it comes to keeping our communities safe, and then share those practices.As long as I m your president, I will do everything in my power to make our communities safer and keep guns out of the wrong hands. That includes calling on Congress to pass the kinds of commonsense reforms supported by the vast majority of the American people.Making progress on these issues is how we honor the lives that have been lost by gun violence, and it s how we leave behind a stronger, more secure nation for our children. The initiative President Obama announced was just put on the White House blog in great detail, which can be found HERE.The president laid out his hope for smart guns back in January as well: Of course, though, the NRA is already fear-baiting their followers and getting people to be afraid of any changes that my take place..@POTUS' new #guncontrol push is ""alarming cops who say they don t want to be guinea pigs."" https://t.co/Auoo6o77wu #2A  NRA (@NRA) April 28, 2016And while the police have every right to be apprehensive, it s important to remember that something, anything, needs to be done to help push forth the effort for a safer United States. Promoting safer guns is an idea that should be embraced by all, and you d think any group, like the NRA, who says they re for  responsible gun ownership  would embrace an idea that made gun ownership more responsible.Within the same Politico article that the NRA tweeted out, it states: [Smart gun technology] wouldn t prevent most mass shootings, gun crimes or suicides   currently the biggest driver of gun deaths. However, they could cut down on the roughly 500 deaths each year from accidental shootings, especially by kids. Advocates also point to findings that most youth suicides are committed with a parents  weapon, and instances where officers  own guns are stolen in a scuffle and used to shoot them cause about 1 in 10 police deaths. It s important to note that this technology probably could have happened a long time ago had it not been for possible political backlash. The gun lobby currently owns several members of Congress, which is truly the biggest obstacle to getting common sense gun reform passed.What President Obama has put forth isn t an attack on guns, it s not an attack on gun owners, and it s not going to limit any rights of those who do and should be able to own guns. What it does is put forth measures to make guns safer, less accessible to those who shouldn t have them, and start a national conversation.The president is taking on the NRA and doesn t really care what they have to say, because all they care about is profit for their gun manufacturer buddies. Something needs to happen, and it needs to happen sooner rather than later.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",0
Trump says Mexico has taken advantage of U.S. 'for long enough',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of Mexico on Friday, saying it “has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough,” as a crisis over border security and trade deepened. “Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change NOW!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned trip to Washington to meet Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border to halt illegal immigration.      The White House also suggested on Thursday that the United States could impose a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for the wall, sending the peso tumbling. Speaking about the scrapped summit, senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway on Friday told Fox News that “the relationship was not imploded. This one meeting has been canceled and that was a mutual cancellation.” In a separate interview on CBS News, she said the tax was one funding possibility and waved off the chance of Mexican retaliation that could cost American jobs, telling CBS News: “They can do what they want.” “Mexico should pay for that wall because they get an awful lot from this country,” Conway told CBS. The White House has said its tax proposal is in the early stages.  A plan being weighed by House Republicans would exempt export revenues from taxation but impose a 20 percent tax on imported goods. The idea, known as a border adjustment tax, would be a significant change from current U.S. policy. Retailers and other businesses that sell imported goods are not keen on the idea, and some lawmakers have expressed concern about its impact on U.S. consumers.  “The costs for everything from groceries, to cars, to office supplies would go up by 20 (percent), making it harder for middle class families to pay for things they need every day,”     Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.

 Former CIA Director Reveals How Putin Recruited Trump To Be A Double Agent,"Former CIA Director Michael J. Morell has written a devastating op-ed in the New York Times. In it, he makes it very clear that he believes the safety of America is at significant risk if the American people elect Donald Trump to the presidency.In the course of that essay, Morell also points out the far-too-cozy relationship Trump has with Russian president Vladimir Putin.The dangers that flow from Mr. Trump s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump s vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated.[ ]In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.Morell also notes that Trump  undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country  and that his bigotry  plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions. The former official points out that Muslims have key roles in defending America, including the man who ran the C.I.A. s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade.He also heaps praise on Hillary Clinton, while making clear that he served under Presidents of both parties   three Democrats and three Republicans. On Clinton Morell says: I found her to be prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument. The essay comes as Trump has begun to collapse in national polls and polls in swing states. They reflect a post-Convention surge in popularity for Clinton, but also reflect disgust over Trump s repeated attacks on the family of a fallen U.S. Army captain.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 5, 2016",0

"Amid opposition, Trump makes low budget request for Mexico border wall","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is asking Congress for $1.6 billion to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, far short of the amount needed for a project sharply criticized by Democrats and even some conservative Republicans.    An internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plan in February estimated the total cost for the wall at $21.6 billion, but the White House’s budget proposal for 2018, released in full on Tuesday, included a request for just $1.6 billion. Two Republican aides in Congress said the modest request is an acknowledgement from the White House that full funding is not realistic given opposition from Freedom Caucus conservatives in the House of Representatives as well as Democrats in the House and the Senate. Unless Trump is able to rally broader support and win more funding for construction in another fiscal year, his plans for a “big beautiful wall” that he promised during his election campaign last year may not be realized, the aides said. The budget, which includes 10-year projections for spending for most areas of the government, did not include a 10-year plan for funding wall construction.  “We are absolutely dead serious about the wall,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Tuesday.  He said the Trump administration was still reviewing prototypes to determine whether to build fences, a brick and mortar wall or some other type of structure.  The $1.6 billion would allow the administration to build small parts of the proposed wall. Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first.  Members of the House Freedom Caucus said earlier this year that Trump would have to show how he would offset the cost of a wall, which Democrats flatly oppose. Facing opposition, the White House pulled its request for full funding for the wall in the 2017 fiscal year and said it would revisit the issue in the next budget.  One of the congressional aides said Trump still lacks the support needed. “Nothing has changed politically on the wall.” So far, the DHS has solicited bids for prototypes of a wall using $20 million in existing funds, but no government contractors have been selected to begin construction. A DHS memo shared with a Senate committee last month said the agency would be able to build 34 miles (55 km) of a levee wall in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley and replace 14 miles (23 km) of fence in San Diego with $1 billion.

UK's Johnson in Iran talks to lobby for jailed aid worker,"DUBAI (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson flew to Tehran on Saturday to seek the release of a jailed British-Iranian aid worker. The Foreign Office said Johnson spoke  frankly  with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif about  consular cases of dual nationals  such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who Britain says was visiting family on holiday when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government. The case has taken on domestic political importance in Britain, especially since Johnson said last month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe trained journalists, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologized. Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison. Johnson is also expected to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday to discuss bilateral and regional issues, a Foreign Office official said, during just the third visit by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Talks with Zarif were  constructive , Johnson s office said, despite differences between the two countries.  They both spoke frankly about the obstacles in the relationship, including the Foreign Secretary s concerns about the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals,  a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in a statement. The two-day visit takes place against a complex backdrop of historical, regional and bilateral tensions. Johnson stressed Britain s support for Iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in the meeting, the spokeswoman said. International sanctions against Iran have only recently been lifted as part of the multilateral nuclear deal to curb Tehran s disputed uranium enrichment program.  That deal is under threat after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to decertify Iran s compliance with its terms. Johnson told Zarif he believed the deal should be fully implemented. Johnson also met Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran s Supreme National Security Council, and parliament speaker Ali Larijani during the first day of his two-day visit, Iran s state news agency IRNA reported. The Foreign Office statement did not mention Zaghari-Ratcliffe by name, although Johnson has vowed to leave  no stone unturned  in Britain s efforts to free her.  A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, she was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but has become the most high-profile case. The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been told she will appear in court on Dec. 10, her husband Richard has said. The visit is a test of Johnson s ability to navigate a political landscape littered with potential pitfalls. Iran s 1979 Islamic Revolution turned it into a pariah state for most of the West and many Middle Eastern neighbors. Britain has voiced its continued support for the nuclear deal but is one of a number of Western powers voicing concerns about Tehran s  destabilizing  influence in the region.

Earlier on Wednesday, Tillerson said there was no truth to reports that President Donald Trump intended to fire him and replace him with CIA chief Mike Pompeo. Directly addressing the issue at a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Tillerson dismissed the reports that overshadowed his week-long trip to Europe which highlighted the yearning of allies for stability in U.S. foreign policy.

"Bulgarian, Macedonian Orthodox Churches edge closer despite thorny history","SOFIA (Reuters) - The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has taken a step towards possible eventual recognition of Macedonia s Orthodox Church, a rapprochement that echoes a warming of relations between the governments of the two Balkan neighbors. However, the move is unlikely to be welcomed by other Orthodox Churches such as those of Serbia and Greece, in a region where religious identity is often closely tied up with nationalist passions and politics. The Macedonian Orthodox Church was formed when the country was part of communist Yugoslavia but has never been recognized by other Orthodox churches due to a long-standing dispute over its independence from the Serbian Orthodox Church, with which it was previously formally united. This month, however, the Macedonian Church sent an official request to Bulgaria s 1,100-year-old Orthodox Church asking it to become its symbolic  mother  church. Bulgaria has close linguistic, cultural and historic ties with Macedonia. In a statement on Monday the Bulgarian Orthodox Church said that  aware of its sacred duty... (it was) taking all necessary steps to establish the canonical status of the Macedonian Church .  We must accept the outstretched hand of Macedonia,  Bulgaria s Orthodox Patriarch Neofit said.  This is the least (we can do) because they are our brothers.  The move comes three months after the prime ministers of Bulgaria and Macedonia signed a friendship treaty in a move designed to end years of diplomatic wrangling and boost Macedonia s European integration. The Bulgarian Church s Holy Synod, its top executive body, will consult with other Eastern Orthodox churches, including those of Russia and Greece and Serbia, before announcing its final decision, it said. The Eastern Orthodox Church is the second largest Christian denomination worldwide with more than 250 million members, but unlike the Roman Catholic Church it has no supreme leader comparable to the Pope but instead is composed mainly of de facto national churches, each led by a patriarch. There was no immediate response on Monday from the Orthodox Church in Serbia, Greece or elsewhere to the Bulgarian move, but they are unlikely to be positive. Greece is locked in a long-running dispute with Macedonia over the country s name, which is also the name of a northern Greek province, and Athens has blocked the Skopje government s attempts to join the European Union and NATO. Russia s Orthodox Church, by far the biggest worldwide, is unlikely to do anything that might compromise Moscow s strong ties with Serbia. Moscow is also opposed to Macedonia s plans to join NATO and the EU. But Bulgaria s Orthodox Church could unilaterally recognize Macedonia s Church, a move sure to cheer Bulgarian nationalists.  The Bulgarian Church must recognize the Macedonian (Church),  Bulgarian Defence Minister Krasimir Karakachanov, co-leader of the United Patriots party, a junior partner in the centre-right coalition government in Sofia, said on Monday.  The two brotherly churches speak without a translator and use the same church books,  he added, alluding to the close linguistic links.  Bulgarian nationalists regard the Macedonian language as a dialect of Bulgarian. ",worldnews,"November 27, 2017 ",1

On Sunday Fiat Chrysler said it would invest $1 billion to modernize two plants in the U.S. Midwest and create 2,000 jobs. “The announcement to invest in the U.S. was already part of our plans,” Marchionne said, adding he had not met Trump since his election victory. Marchionne said he did not want to speak for the new U.S. President-to-be but added commercial barriers could be an “obstacle to development”. ",politicsNews,"January 9, 2017 ",1
Pakistani Taliban says behind deadly blast in tribal region,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The militant Pakistani Taliban group said it carried out an attack on Sunday that killed five people in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) spokesman Mohammad Khurassani said the militants planted an improvised explosive device  to target security personnel  in the Bajaur Agency area that is part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The blast struck a vehicle in the Mamund area of Bajaur, killing four security personnel and an official from the civilian administration, local government sources said. Bajaur is one of the Pashtun tribal regions near the Afghan border. Security in the region has improved in recent years after the Pakistani military mounted offensives there against the al Qaeda-linked Pakistani Taliban, which is considered the country s biggest security threat. But militants continue to stage attacks in FATA, which remains off-bounds for foreigners and is considered one of the most volatile parts of the nuclear-armed nation of 208 million people.

Trump campaign releases tax returns for Republican VP nominee Pence,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s Republican presidential campaign, widely criticized for refusing to release the candidate’s tax returns, released 10 years of returns on Friday for vice presidential nominee Mike Pence. The Trump campaign also repeated a pledge that Trump would release his own returns once the government completes an audit. Pence’s returns for 2006 to 2015 showed the Indiana governor and former U.S. congressman paid an effective tax rate that ranged from 10 percent to 16.5 percent. “These returns are being released with the full support of Mr. Trump who plans to release his tax returns upon completion of a routine audit,” the campaign said. Disclosure of tax returns is a standard procedure for all modern presidential candidates. Trump’s critics, including the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, have suggested he may be hiding something. Some have speculated that Trump may pay little or no tax or that his net worth may be much less than the $10 billion he has claimed.  Pence and his wife, Karen, reported adjusted gross income over the 10 years ranging from about $113,000 last year to over $187,000 in 2009, while the effective state and federal tax rate ranged from a low of just over 10 percent in 2013 to a high of 16.5 percent in 2014, the figures show.  Charitable donations amounted to 10 percent of the family’s take-home pay, equivalent to an average 7.2 percent of adjusted gross income, a statement released by the Trump campaign said. Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns last month. They showed she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. Most of the income came from Bill Clinton’s speaking fees and a book deal by Hillary. Clinton’s running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns at the same time in August. They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent on income of about $313,000 in 2015. ",politicsNews,"September 10, 2016 ",1
Giuliani pulls out of consideration to serve in administration: Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Friday he had removed his name from consideration for a position in Donald Trump’s new administration as the president-elect narrows the field of people he is considering for secretary of state. Giuliani’s withdrawal from consideration came after Trump made clear that he was broadening his search for a secretary of state beyond the four finalists transition aides had identified: Giuliani, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former CIA head David Petraeus and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. In recent days, Trump has expanded his search for a secretary of state to include additional lawmakers and corporate executives, such as Rex Tillerson of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Alan Mulally, a former executive at Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). The Wall Street Journal, citing two transition team officials, said Tillerson had emerged on Friday as the leading candidate for the State Department job. It said some Trump advisers saw Tillerson as a mold-breaking pick who would bring an executive’s experience to the post of top U.S. diplomat. Giuliani, speaking to Fox News, said he had actually sent a letter withdrawing himself from consideration back on Nov. 29 but that the transition team had rejected it, saying they wanted to continue to keep him in the running for the State Department. “I decided ... that the whole thing was becoming ... very difficult for the president-elect, and my desire to be in the Cabinet was great, but it wasn’t that great and he had a lot of terrific candidates,” Giuliani said in a phone call with Fox. He said he had met Trump on Friday and they agreed it was worth going ahead and releasing the letter as the president-elect narrows his choice for secretary of state. Trump indicated to supporters in Louisiana on Friday that he would have another Cabinet announcement next week “you’re really going to like.” “They’re down to the last two, three, four (candidates), so it made sense to ... get out of the way,” Giuliani said in the Fox interview. He said he had been considered for other positions in the Cabinet but was not keen on a role other than State Department. “That was the only one I had any real interest in. But it wasn’t so overwhelming that I’m terribly disappointed,” Giuliani added, noting that he would continue to act as a friend and informal adviser to Trump. Asked his view on Romney as a possible secretary of state, Giuliani said he agreed with other “very loyal supporters of President-elect Trump” that “Mitt went over the line” in his criticism of the candidate during the campaign. “You can make friends and make up, but I wouldn’t see him as a candidate for the Cabinet,” Giuliani said, though he added he would accept whatever decision Trump ultimately made. Giuliani’s withdrawal was likely to disappoint some of Trump’s most loyal aides, who appreciated how he had supported the president-elect all along and had been resistant to Romney. Earlier on Friday, CNN, citing an unnamed source, reported that Giuliani was told he was no longer in contention for secretary of state. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, praised the former New York mayor in a statement. “Rudy Giuliani is an extraordinarily talented and patriotic American,” the New York businessman said. “He is and continues to be a close personal friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date.” Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, said in the statement that Giuliani “was vetted by our team for any possible conflicts and passed with flying colors.” Giuliani also told Fox the vetting process had turned up no conflicts.

Mexico presidential hopeful hemmed in by ruling party legacy,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mired in allegations of corruption, Mexico s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has thrown its weight behind an untainted outsider in a bid to clean up its image and hang on to the presidency in elections next July. But having never been a member of the party, former finance minister and PRI presidential hopeful Jose Antonio Meade faces a delicate balancing act persuading undecided voters he will cut out graft without alienating the grassroots support he needs to win. It is proving to be a tough job. The awkward symbiosis limits Meade s ability to play to the strengths that PRI grandees hope will overcome the accusations of embezzlement, fraud and vote buying that have plagued the party under President Enrique Pena Nieto. Reliant on the PRI machinery to deliver votes, Meade must wrap himself in the party banner, while distancing his campaign from the failures of the outgoing government he also represents.  He s between a rock and a hard place,  said Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister. Pena Nieto is constitutionally barred from re-election, and the centrist PRI will not formally elect its candidate until Feb. 18. However, the party has lined up behind Meade, who held various cabinet posts across two opposing administrations before announcing his run late last month. Meade, a technocrat with a sharp command of the minutiae of the economy, launched his campaign for the PRI candidacy in a straw sombrero festooned with red and green streamers in the poor southern town of San Juan Chamula on Dec. 14. Meade acknowledged Pena Nieto in his speech, which called for a  secure and just Mexico.  But he did not detail policies or directly address corruption. Like the president, he has said graft must be attacked by strengthening institutions. In subsequent outings to rally the PRI faithful, he has continued to frame his vision in general terms - prompting expressions of dismay by some of his supporters.  It s a typical PRI campaign,  said one pro-Meade lawmaker, shaking his head, and speaking on condition of anonymity. Polls show Meade has plenty of work to do. A survey by polling firm Parametria published on Dec. 19 put him 11 percentage points behind leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who has spent years railing against corruption and inequality. Another survey, by pollster Mitofsky, showed this month that 57.4 percent of voters reject the PRI, up nearly seven points from October, and 17 points more than any other party. In December 2011, the same point in the previous campaign, the PRI had a lead of about 17 points and only one in five voters rejected the party, according to Mitofsky data. Serving in the cabinet for almost seven years running, Meade has sold himself as irreproachably honest and the safest pair of hands for the economy, painting Lopez Obrador and conservative rival Ricardo Anaya as risky bets for Mexico s stability. However, his time in government has left the 48-year-old with a problematic legacy to defend. Gang violence has worsened in the past couple of years, with murders hitting a record high in 2017. [L1N1ON0EQ] Meanwhile the economy is growing at barely 2 percent annually, less than half the rate the government first targeted, inflation is near a 16-year high and the peso has depreciated by more than 34 percent against the dollar under Pena Nieto. A study by the Pew Research Center in September identified crime and corruption as the top concerns for Mexicans. As standard-bearer for an unpopular government, Meade has to present more compelling solutions to those problems than his rivals, said one senior official backing him.   It was one of this government s biggest mistakes not to see the damage that corruption could do to its reputation,  said the official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said he believed Meade s policies could become clearer once he is formally invested as PRI candidate. Meade s campaign did not reply to requests for comment. Another government official closely following the campaign said that while Meade could recognize failings in the PRI, he could not be expected to attack the party.  You can t take the PRI s core vote for granted,  the official said. With some PRI governors, lawmakers and Pena Nieto facing allegations of corruption, it could be  suicidal  for Meade to  push a tough line on graft, said Juan Pardinas, general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a think tank.  How could you (take) a strong stance against corruption, being the PRI candidate?,  he asked.  It s like (taking) a strong stance against racism at a Ku Klux Klan rally.

SPECTACULAR! LEFTIST MEDIA MELTS DOWN When They Realize America Didn’t Buy Their Lies…Elected Trump Anyhow [VIDEO],"They pulled every trick in the book. From manufactured polls designed to discourage Trump supporters from going to vote on election day, to an all-out assassination attempt on his character, you ve gotta hand it to these propagandists, there wasn t a dirty trick they didn t try. Trump took abuse by the media like no other Presidential candidate before him. Even after our dishonest media was caught working behind the scenes with Crooked Hillary, her campaign and the DNC, they still came at Trump with a shameless vengeance like we ve never seen. What the media didn t understand however, was that every time we saw Trump alone in the ring against a mob of unruly leftist  journalists  fighting back with everything he had, it only strengthened our resolve.In Trump, Americans saw something that s been missing from our politicians for decades, we saw someone who was actually willing o fight for our nation on our behalf. We saw someone who wasn t going to concede to political correctness, or to give our lying media respect they didn t deserve. Every time he called them out for their dishonesty, Americans cheered.  Every time they hit Trump with another lie, or worked in unison to impugn his character, he always managed to come back even stronger than before.Trump wasn t interested in playing by the media s rules, and they did everything in their power to punish him for not playing along. Along the way, he brilliantly exposed them as nothing more than an extension of Hillary Clinton s campaign.

BAMN is perhaps best known, however, for a 2016 incident in which they showed up to a rally held by the white-nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party outside the California state capitol building in Sacramento. The militant group was confrontational with the white-nationalists within minutes of arrival, and ten people were stabbed and hospitalized in a bloody fight. Police have verified through videos taken by members of the group, news organizations, and bystanders, that BAMN initiated the violence. Falarco was caught on camera at the event repeatedly punching a man in the stomach and throwing him to the ground.Arreguin, a far-left liberal, made headlines in February for his tweets prior to BAMN organizing a riot to prevent right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the city s University of California campus. Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn t welcome in our community,  Arreguin had tweeted.The mayor also referred to Yiannopoulos as a  white supremacist,  and was forced to issue an  apology. I consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful. But I regret and apologize for the white national label,  Arreguin tweeted.Hours after his tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to listen to Yiannopoulos speak were under a violent attack. People were assaulted with pipes, a generator-powered spotlight was firebombed, and looters destroyed several businesses in the area including a Starbucks.The rioters smashed windows, spray painted violent messages all over the area   including  Kill Trump    and began committing arsons. It was estimated that the rioters caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK Student Union, and $400,000 to $500,000 in damage to the area surrounding the university.It was immediately alleged that the mayor had ordered the police to stand down and allow the violence and destruction.Arreguin denied the accusations, saying that the police strategy was ordered by the department, not him.

Venezuela ex-prosecutor says she has evidence of Maduro corruption,"BRASILIA/CARACAS (Reuters) - Dismissed Venezuelan prosecutor Luisa Ortega said on Wednesday she had evidence that President Nicolas Maduro was involved in corruption with construction company Odebrecht. Ortega, 59, was a key player in Venezuela s government but broke with it in March. She fled last week to Colombia by boat and on Wednesday morning landed in Brazil. Ortega said she had been persecuted in an effort to hide details of high-level corruption, saying she had proof, though she offered none. Ortega linked the Odebrecht scandal with Maduro and Socialist Party heavyweights including Diosdado Cabello and Jorge Rodriguez. Ortega said she had evidence that Cabello received some $100 million from the Brazilian company.  The international community must investigate such cases,  she told a news conference. Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment. Odebrecht admitted in a settlement with U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors to paying bribes across 12 countries to win contracts. According to a U.S. court ruling, between 2001 and 2016, Odebrecht paid about $788 million in bribes in countries including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. Ortega was removed from her position early this month by Venezuela s newly formed constituent assembly, a controversial pro-government body whose installation was called dictatorial by governments worldwide. Maduro said on Tuesday he would seek Ortega s arrest, accusing her of having worked for some time with the United States. Maduro blames Washington for many of Venezuela s problems, including triple-digit inflation, shortages of basic goods and months of anti-government unrest. In Caracas, state-controlled television broadcast images on Wednesday of a police operation in what it said was Ortega s apartment. The cameras showed marble floors, large paintings of Ortega herself and one by Andy Warhol, a cellar containing an array of expensive wines and a wardrobe filled with designer labels. Ortega said she would give details of the corruption cases to authorities in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Since settling in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland for a record $3.5 billion, Odebrecht has sought to negotiate leniency deals that would allow it to keep operating in other countries across Latin America.

Really? That s the best you could come up with?  Warren quipped.  I thought Donald Trump said he was a guy who was good with words. She then went on to describe what the economy would be like under a Trump presidency. I think it will be more of a government that works for a thin slice at the top, and a government that leaves everyone else behind. And the problem with that is it s not just government. Government becomes the tool then to have the economy work that way. So increasingly we live in a world where the economy works for a narrower and narrower slice of America. Here s the video via YouTube.Warren is right to laugh at Trump. After all, he s the biggest joke in American politics right now. But, he s also dangerous as Warren pointed out. And not just to the economy. Trump has no foreign policy experience and has indicated that he would use the military and torture rather than diplomacy to achieve American goals overseas.Furthermore, Trump is also a threat to civil rights and a free press and brings no real substantive ideas to the table. He is nothing more than hateful warmonger who would create an economy to help himself and his wealthy friends at the expense of the rest of us.That s why we need people like Elizabeth Warren in the Senate and on the presidential ticket to offer Americans a real choice.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",0
"Israel hails Trump's 'historic' declaration, Palestinians condemn","JERUSALEM/RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Israel hailed U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as its capital on Wednesday, but the Palestinians condemned the move and said it diminished Washington s role as a peace mediator. In a landmark speech in Washington, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy in defiance of warnings from around the world that the gesture risked creating further unrest in the Middle East. Past U.S. presidents have insisted that the status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions - must be decided in negotiations between the two sides. Palestinian factions called a general strike on Thursday throughout the occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Palestinian areas of Jerusalem and for rallies to be held at midday (1000 GMT) in protest at Trump s move, raising the chances of violent clashes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message that Trump s decision had made for a  historic day  and was  an important step toward peace .     He added that any peace deal with the Palestinians would have to include Jerusalem as Israel s capital and he urged other countries to follow the U.S. lead by also moving their embassies to the city. He said there would be no change to access to Jerusalem s holy sites.  Israel will always ensure freedom of worship for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.  But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump s move was  tantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator  and declared Jerusalem as the  eternal capital of the State of Palestine . Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. It later annexed it, declaring the whole of the city as its capital, a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state which they want to establish in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  With this announcement, the American administration has chosen to violate all international and bilateral agreements and resolutions and it has chosen to violate international consensus,  Abbas said. The move, he said, would serve  the extremist groups which try to turn the conflict in our region into a religious war that will drag the region ... into international conflicts and endless wars.  Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen since 2014. Trump s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is leading Trump s efforts to restart them but those efforts have shown little progress. Israel s West Bank settlement building has been one of the main obstacles. Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, said Trump s move was  flagrant aggression against the Palestinian people  and urged Arabs and Muslims to  undermine the U.S. s interests in the region  and to  shun Israel.

HILLARY’S VP NOMINEE PANDERS TO BLACKS: “I done apologized for slavery”,"Yes, he did say that bad grammar and all! Can you believe a man running for VP said something like that? Sen.

I done the same thing as mayor of Richmond. I worked   to plan, fundraise and then construct and unveil a civil rights memorial on our capital grounds,  he boasted.Aside from the bad grammar, why is he apologizing for something he didn t do for people who had nothing to do with slavery to people who were never enslaved?

Pro-business parties try to hem German Greens in with red lines,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The premier of Germany s most populous region warned that the Green party would have to step back from some of its environmentalist red lines if it wanted to join a mooted three-party coalition led by conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel. Armin Laschet, premier of the industrial heartland state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said in an interview with Handelsblatt newspaper that his and Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) would not do a coalition deal at any price. Earlier, Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), the likely third coalition partner, had also said the Greens would need to sacrifice a commitment to environmentalist subsidies and accept tax cuts. With a  Jamaica coalition  of the conservatives (black), the FDP (yellow) and the Greens the most plausible coalition after last Sunday s national vote, the parties that enjoy the overwhelming support of Germany s business community rushed to hem in the leftist Greens with red lines.  A Jamaica coalition agreement must make clear that there will be no de-industrialization,  said Laschet, whose state is home to one of Germany s largest concentrations of heavy industry. The Greens  wish for fixed target dates for banning polluting combustion engines or coal-fired power stations would harm industry, he added. Lindner, whose party is popular among the family businesses traditionally seen as the backbone of the German economy, told mass-selling paper Bild am Sonntag that he would be happy to accept a tax-cutting Green as finance minister.  It would be fine to have a Green finance minister who cuts the tax burden on the middle classes,  said Lindner, seen as one of the leading candidates for the key finance job in a Jamaica coalition. The Greens voted on Saturday to start exploratory talks on a deal, indicating that they would like to see a softening of the FDP s tough line on immigration. Laschet said talks on a post-election three-way deal, the first in Germany since the 1950s, could last into next year, though he hoped for a deal before January. ",worldnews,"October 1, 2017 ",1
Trump taps ex-labor board member Acosta to be labor secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday nominated former National Labor Relations Board member R. Alexander Acosta to serve as U.S. secretary of labor, one day after Trump’s original choice withdrew. Acosta is dean of the Florida International University College of Law in Miami and is Trump’s first Hispanic nominee.  Acosta has had a decades-long public service career, serving in three presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed positions, and is expected to face a smooth confirmation process. “Mr. Acosta’s nomination is off to a good start because he’s already been confirmed by the Senate three times,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that will be vetting the nomination. Acosta was appointed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by former Republican President George W. Bush, who also appointed him to be assistant attorney general in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  He was then appointed to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where he went after high-profile defendants such as Jack Abramoff and UBS, resulting in the Swiss bank paying more than $750 million in fines for a tax-avoidance scheme. Acosta also previously served as a law clerk to Samuel Alito from 1994 to 1995, when the conservative Supreme Court justice was a judge at the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “I thank the President and his staff for their confidence in me and I am eager to work tirelessly on behalf of the American worker,” Acosta said in a statement. While at the NLRB, Acosta signed hundreds of opinions. Those familiar with his work describe him as a careful and cautious public servant whose career trajectory suggested he may someday vie for a federal judgeship. Because he has already gone through multiple vettings by the U.S. Senate, it is unlikely there will be any surprises in his background that could derail his nomination. The choice of Acosta, a traditional Republican conservative, is seen by some as a sign that Trump was forced to give up a more aggressive policy on worker issues. Trump’s first labor secretary pick, Andrew Puzder, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, was outspoken in opposition to issues such as overtime pay, minimum wage hikes and even discussed the superiority of robots over human workers. He removed his name from consideration on Wednesday amid concerns he could not garner enough Senate votes to be confirmed.  “This is the humbling of Donald Trump,” said Seth Harris, a former Acting Labor Secretary during the Obama administration, who said Puzder would have been a “radical disruptor” but Acosta won’t be. Acosta has been a staunch defender of the civil rights of Muslims who faced a backlash after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. In a 2011 congressional hearing, Acosta applauded how the Justice Department responded to civil rights violations, saying they helped assure Muslim Americans that “their government would protect their rights.” Some progressive groups were already responding negatively to the Acosta appointment, with Allied Progress alleging he had mismanaged the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division when he ran it.  In 2008, an internal Justice Department report faulted Acosta for failing to rein in a staffer who engaged in improper politicized hiring. However, the response to Acosta’s nomination from union groups who had staunchly opposed Puzder was much more measured on Thursday. “Unlike Andy Puzder, Alexander Acosta’s nomination deserves serious consideration,” said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  “In one day, we’ve gone from a fast-food CEO who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it.” ",politicsNews,"February 16, 2017 ",1
" Donors Are So TERRIFIED Of Trump, They’re Begging GOP To Find 3rd Party Candidate To Sabotage Him","Conservative donors are shaking in their boots over the idea of a Trump presidency destroying the Republican party, and the last 35 years of their promotion of plutocracy in America. Things have gotten so bad for them in the face of Trump s virtually unstoppable campaign, that they are now throwing money at a GOP consulting firm to figure out if a late-term independent 3rd party run could be initiated if Trump wins the Republican nomination.The document, which was supposed to remain confidential, was created by staff at Data Targeting, which is a right-wing political firm in Gainesville Florida. The memo says that it is possible to mount an independent candidacy but [it] will require immediate action on the part of this core of key funding and strategic players. All this research has to happen before March 16, when inevitably Trump is the nominee, so that we have a plan in place,  an inside source that was part of the development of the document said. March 16 is the day after the Republican primary in Florida, which is winner-take-all for the victor. Marco Rubio supporters are hoping that they can win this one to halt Trump s so far unstoppable momentum. As it is now, Rubio s prospects for this are growing dimmer by the day. The latest Real Clear Politics poll shows Trump at 40.3 to Rubio s 20.8. It will be almost impossible for Rubio to beat Trump in his home state at this rate.The process of creating a third-party  independent  to run is not going to be easy. The candidate would need to gather over 79,900 petition signatures in Texas by May 9, and 89,000 in North Carolina by June 9. While this is possible in the time allotted, finding some relative unknown and suddenly propping him or her up as the great white hope of the Republican party will be met with jeers by many. As dumb as Republican voters may be, they aren t going to suddenly start voting for a corporate funded nobody.Texas and North Carolina have been pegged as the litmus test due to Texas s 38 electoral votes being a necessity for any Republican win, and North Carolina s status as a swing state that leans Republican. A failure in these states for a third-party candidate would make it nearly impossible for a 3rd party win.It s possible that the third-party candidate could still run, in an effort to simply prevent a Trump presidency at the cost of letting the Democrats retain control. A Trump nomination is going to be embarrassing enough for Republicans. An actual Trump presidency would possibly damage the party permanently beyond repair. It s only a theory, but if it came down to destroying the party or waiting at least 4 more years, they will take the latter.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 26, 2016",0
Six Ugandan MPs ejected in rowdy debate to extend rule of aging Museveni,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - A move to change Uganda s constitution to allow President Yoweri Museveni to rule beyond the age of 75 provoked rowdy scenes in parliament on Monday in which six legislators were ejected from the chamber. Museveni, 73, has ruled the east African country for 31 years. Under the current age cap, the constitution would bar him from standing again as president in 2021. Parliament on Monday began debating a bill, presented by a Museveni loyalist, that proposes removing the stipulation a presidential candidate cannot be more than 75 years old, something which opposition activists and rights groups say opens the door for him to be president for life. Religious leaders and even some MPs from Museveni s National Resistance Movement (NRM) party have criticized the proposed bill, which needs two thirds of all voting house members to pass. But the NRM is expected to easily muster enough votes. Protests against the move have been put down with detentions, teargas and live bullets, leaving at least two dead in October. On Monday, debate proceeded amid heavy deployments of police and military personnel at parliament. After jeering and heckling erupted in the chamber, the six lawmakers were suspended for a single session and ordered out for  undermining the authority of the speaker [and] undermining decorum in the house,  parliament spokesman Chris Obore told Reuters. The MPs had heckled speaker Rebecca Kadaga and ignored her orders to be seated, Obore said. House proceedings were adjourned for several hours after the MPs were sent out and resumed later in the afternoon to hear a report from a parliamentary committee that conducted public hearings on the bill.  A report by the majority of the MPs on the committee endorsed the proposal to scrap the age cap and also recommended that the length of a presidential term be extended to seven from the current five years.  Some legislators on the committee disagreed and wrote a minority report.  It s our view that the proposal...only seeks to promote life presidency as well as negate modern practices of constitutionalism,  MP Monicah Amoding, who read the minority report, said. In the mostly acrimonious debate, legislators often shouted each other down and jeered. Opposition MPs, who dominated the debate, tried unsuccessfully to stall the process. The speaker adjourned the session to Tuesday after she said the chamber s microphones were experiencing a glitch. In late September, lawmakers brawled in parliament for two consecutive days as MPs opposed to the bill attempted to filibuster it but were defeated. At least 25 MPs opposed to the proposed constitutional amendment to prolong Museveni s tenure were forcibly ejected on orders of the speaker for involvement in fighting.  Museveni initially won broad international support for his embrace of market economics and restoring political order after years of turmoil in the east African country. But in recent years he has come under a growing spotlight for a range of rights violations, corruption and his unwillingness to give up power. Democracy advocates have expressed alarm at the reemergence of a trend by leaders in the region to seek to change laws, delay elections or use other tactics to extend their tenures.  In Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo such maneuvers have provoked instability.  ",worldnews,"December 18, 2017 ",1
 Dem. Senator BLASTS Mitch McConnell For Excluding Women From Panel Drafting New Senate Health Plan,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced who he has selected to take on crafting the Senate version of the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), but Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is having none of it and blasted McConnell for not putting any of the female senators in the group.Feinstein expressed her extreme displeasure with the decision to exclude women from this important panel on Meet the Press. She told Andrea Mitchell, I don t know what the 13 white men, when you have five Republican women who are excluded from that, that these 13 men are supposed to sit down and put something together. One main problem with leaving women off of this key panel is that as passed by the House, the ACHA drastically changed the way pre-existing conditions are treated. Under the Affordable Care Act, premiums could not be raised nor could coverage be denied to people with pre-existing health issues. While many of these problems can affect men and women, such as depression and acne, some only apply to women. For example, pregnancy and problems with menstruation can be considered pre-existing conditions under the House bill.Feinstein noted that women s health care has to be considered when they draft the Senate bill. As for responses to the House bill, The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the National Physicians Alliance have all come out against the ACHA.  Feinstein added, Women s health is a big part of this, and women are a majority of the population and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform. I m really very worried that in the rush to judgment, we create a major healthcare problem for people. And we lose a lot of jobs in so doing and we create a whole atmosphere of unpredictability. For an idea of what they may now consider pre-existing conditions, this is just the short list of what might force someone to pay more under Trump s plan, as passed by the House. By making it legal to charge people more for having these problems, they may not be officially barring them from getting insurance but they will make it too expensive for people to afford it.This list is not complete, but you get the gist. Barring women from any discussions relating to this new draft for the Senate is absolutely absurd and it s just one more reason why we have to keep resisting   they can t be allowed to pass this bill without every voice being heard. Call your senators now before it s too late!Featured image via Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.",News,"May 7, 2017",0
Mladic still a hero in dying home village in Bosnia,"BOZANOVICI, Bosnia (Reuters) - The sign nailed to a tree marking one of the few paved roads bears the name of the village s favorite son:  General Mladic Street . In a garage that serves as the makeshift tavern, his portrait looks down on the men who spend the day sharing a bottle of brandy. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb military commander who will hear his verdict on charges of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity next week in the Hague, is one of the highest profile war crimes suspects in Europe since Nuremberg. In the international court where his trial began more than five years ago, he is accused of ordering the killing of 8,000 unarmed Muslim men and boys after the capture of the town of Srebrenica, and raining artillery on civilians during the siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. But here in his home village, where barely two dozen people   mostly his blood relatives   still remain in the hardscrabble countryside of the Bosnian hills, Mladic is, as the slogan on his portrait above the drinkers declares,  a hero .  He did not do such things. Others did it. The general is a colossus, a great and good man,  said Zoran Mladic, one of several villagers who identify themselves as cousins of the ex-general. Mladic, who was captured in 2011 after a decade and a half on the run, is still revered in the Serb sector of Bosnia as a hero and defender of the nation during the 1992-1995 war that killed more than 100,000 people. In his native village of crumbling cabins scattered across the slopes, every home has his portrait. Villagers pay him the ultimate compliment: he was a good worker, who often came back to visit, and a useful hand bringing in the harvest as a reaper in the fields.  He did not kill people. During the war he gathered our Muslim neighbors from a nearby village and warned them in time to leave,  said Dusko Mladic, another cousin, sitting in the tavern, who said he was a childhood playmate of the general.  I still often go to that village, work with Muslims and don t have any problems,  he said. The villagers are mainly farmers who keep cattle and sell produce in Sarajevo, which Mladic s forces kept under a 43-month siege, bombing its citizens daily and depriving them of water, power and food.  Today, as in much of the countryside, the younger generation has largely abandoned the village to go to Sarajevo in search of jobs. Those left behind barely survive on small pensions and the sale of milk and meat, disappointed at the lack of support by the Bosnian Serb authorities. They fear Mladic will be convicted and remembered as a war criminal.  I would be happiest if he died before the judgment,  said another cousin, Mile Mladic. That was the fate of Slobodan Milosevic, the former leader of Serbia, who died four years into his own genocide trial, ending it without a verdict.  We would then raise a large monument for him in the village and write the truth. All this that is happening is not the truth. It is a lie. The general is not guilty.

 Chicago Police Say They Did Not Tell Trump To Cancel UIC Rally (VIDEO),"As Addicting Info reported here, Donald Trump s scheduled rally in Chicago, Illinois was shut down after thousands of protesters showed up to take a stand against the republican candidate s politics of hate.Video posted to social media shows the crowd inside the University of Illinois  Chicago pavilion bursting into cheers and jeers, as an announcer broke the news that Mr. Trump would not be making an appearance at the rally, saying: Mr. Trump just arrived in Chicago and after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight s rally will be postponed until another date. Trump repeated the statement later, during an interview with MSNBC s Chris Matthews. After speaking with law enforcement, I just thought it would be a wise thing for us to postpone this rally. But Chicago police say that Trump s statement is not true.The Chicago Police Department released a formal statement regarding the cancelled rally, saying: CPD did not meet with the Trump campaign prior to the cancellation of the event, nor did we make any suggestion that the event be cancelled. According to Chicago Police Interim Supt. John Escalante, the Chicago police previously assured Trump that they had more than enough police presence to negate any safety risks at the event.Escalante told Matthews: The Chicago Police Department had no role,  in the decision to cancel the rally. In fact, I can tell you we did assure the Trump campaign that we had more than adequate resources outside the UIC Pavilion and that we guaranteed them we could provide safe access and exit for Mr. Trump. Here s more on the story from CBS Chicago.We always knew that Donald Trump was a lying windbag.But Friday s events give us an even better idea of how Trump would respond in the face of even the slightest threat.The brave, bold leader of the far right abandoned his faithful followers without a second thought. And all because some Black and brown people showed up to one of his rallies, carrying protest signs.Yet Trump would have them believe that in the face of a real terror attack, he d never, ever disappear from the radar the way George W.

His supporters aren t the type of people who would forgive their supposedly-fearless leader for admitting that he s a big fat coward.It takes absolutely no courage to spew a lot of racist, hate speech to an auditorium full of people who share your disturbing worldview.On the other hand, it takes enormous courage to stand up against the kind of hate that the right wing is spreading in America.It takes courage to walk into an arena packed full of rabid Trump supporters; people who believe that what our country needs right now is more hate, more fear, more ugliness, more racism, more religious bigotry, more intolerance, more violence  and stand against those messages, chanting  Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Donald Trump has got to go,  and  Bernie!

Wisconsin governor backs Republican Ted Cruz in presidential race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz won the backing on Tuesday of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, gaining a boost in the contentious three-way race a week before that state’s presidential primary. Walker, himself a former Republican presidential candidate, emphasized he was not endorsing the U.S. senator from Texas in an effort to thwart Republican front-runner Donald Trump from clinching the party’s nomination for the Nov. 8 election. “To me, I’m all in,” Walker said in a radio interview on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee. He said he planned to campaign for Cruz throughout the state before the April 5 Wisconsin primary. Wisconsin polls, though scarce, show Trump and Cruz running neck-and-neck in the state. A recent Emerson poll showed Cruz taking 36 percent and Trump with 35 percent. Ohio Governor John Kasich lagged in third place, with 19 percent. Walker said he chose to back Cruz because he was a principled constitutional conservative who would stand up to big government special interests and give power to the states.  “I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, if you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and to then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall this year,” Walker said.  Walker’s endorsement adds to a number of other more mainstream Republicans stepping up behind Cruz as the best alternative to Trump, who has racked up a strong delegate lead but alienated many party leaders with his harsh views on immigration, Muslims and women.

"Obama signs defense spending bill, criticizes Guantanamo policy","HONOLULU (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law an annual defense policy bill, but in a lengthy statement he raised objections to parts of it, including policies blocking him from closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama pledged in his 2008 presidential campaign to close the military prison, but his efforts have been blocked by mostly Republican opposition in Congress. The Democratic president has instead reduced the population there by transferring prisoners to other countries.  The administration recently told Congress it would move up to 18 more prisoners of the 59 remaining at Guantanamo before Obama leaves office next month. “During my administration, we have responsibly transferred over 175 detainees from Guantanamo,” Obama said in the statement on Friday. “Our efforts to transfer additional detainees will continue until the last day I am in office.” President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, said during the campaign that he would keep the Guantanamo Bay facility open and vowed to “load it up with some bad dudes.” The $618.7 billion defense spending bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress this month was a compromise version that dropped controversial language requiring women to register for the draft. But it kept some Republican-backed initiatives Obama had opposed. The legislation boosts military spending when there has been no similar increase in non-defense funding, and it bars closures of military bases even though top Pentagon officials say they have too much capacity.     House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said on Friday the legislation would give U.S. troops a pay raise and praised the Guantanamo language. “This ensures that, right up until his last hour in office, President Obama will not be able to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States,” Ryan said in a statement. Obama’s predecessor George W. Bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the Sept. 11 attacks. Under Bush, the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Obama has maintained for years that he considers “onerous restrictions” on his ability to transfer prisoners a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. But he gave no indication he would try to override those restrictions. Reflecting the growing migration of espionage and warfare into cyberspace, Obama also said on Friday that he favors splitting the U.S. Cyber Command, which conducts offensive operations, from the National Security Agency and making it independent, similar to the military’s European and Pacific Commands.

 You Really Don’t Want To Miss Ana Navarro PUMMEL Trump’s Chief Racism Apologist (VIDEO),"When it comes to Donald Trump and his number of apologists sent out to every media outlet to justify his horrific behavior, the media has been less than extraordinary at calling out their utter bullsh*t.However, leave it to Ana Navarro, notably a conservative, to absolutely rip Trump s number one apologist apart during a recent segment on CNN.Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is now a regular commentator on CNN.  Remember that the next time Trump wants to say the media has a liberal bias. Lewandowski decided he would defend Trump s racism and awful remarks, and Navarro clearly has had just about enough of his shenanigans.Navarro, laying it all out on the table, brilliantly came back at Lewandowski and said: I will tell you something. I will take credit for insulting him. Because he s been insulting communities since the first day he launched his campaign, when he started talking about Mexican rapists   The reason I can call Donald Trump names and I can insult him back is because I am the sister of a disabled man and he mocked that disabled man, because I am the friend of a POW and he mocked that POW, because I m an immigrant and he has insulted immigrants, because I m a Hispanic and he has insulted Hispanics, because I am a woman and he has insulted women. So, yeah, we re at the point where there s insults and name-calling. But I would just say that he threw that rock first. He is the one who has lowered the debate to the level that it is at. However, honestly, my favorite part is when Lewandowski tried to go after Navarro personally trying to discredit her own experience, because this is what Trump and his lackeys do, and she swung back with: Oh, Corey, do me a favor, before you go attacking me   oh, let me tell you something, let me play my little violin for you. Ha!As it s long been said, the moment you need to enter into personal attacks and not just attacks on policy, you have already lost. Both Trump and his lemmings, including Lewandowski, are nothing but losers who resort to just insulting people because that s honestly all they have.

TRUMP SLAMS OBAMA AND VOWS To Undo Cuban Policy,"Last year Obama added an action to his manifesto that would forever put him in the cross-hairs of Americans nationwide when he announced that he would be normalizing diplomatic relations with Communist-Cuba. Cuban-Americans were deeply offended and angered that Obama would extend the hand of friendship to the very regime that ha tortured and murdered their family members for years simply for having an opinion.Here are just a few facts from Obamas Policy on Cuba:*General tourist travel is still prohibited, but Americans authorized to visit Cuba for any of a dozen specific reasons can do so without first obtaining a special license from the government. The 12 categories of acceptable travel include family visits, official visits, journalistic, professional, educational and religious activities, and public performances.*Licensed U.S. travelers to Cuba can use credit cards and spend money in the country, and are able to import $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including up to $100 in tobacco and alcohol products. *Americans can send more money to Cubans, up to $2,000 every three months instead of the $500 currently permitted. *U.S. citizens can bring home small amounts of Cuban cigars. *U.S. companies will be able to export cell phones, televisions, memory and recording devices, computers and software to Cuba. Cuba is known to have poor Internet and telecommunications infrastructure.Thankfully in Miami on Friday, Trump announced at his rally that when elected he would be undoing that order unless Cuba met OUR demands first.Trump promised to  stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression  and condemned Obama s  concessions  to the Castro regime. All of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them, and that, I will do, unless the Castro regime meets our demands   not my demands, our demands.  Obama can t really seem to shock us anymore however, he has made deals and woven ties with numerous terroristic countries over his 8 years in office, and yet we still see no actually improvement in our own country.

JAMES COMEY’S Bombshell Pre-Testimony Statement,"Read former FBI Director James Comey s full statement below:Statement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence James B. Comey June 8, 2017Chairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with President-Elect and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee.January 6 BriefingI first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI s counter-intelligence responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect. Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBI s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct.It is important to understand that FBI counter-intelligence investigations are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work. The Bureau s goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves  turning  the recruited person into a double-agent, or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy-based intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities.Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will  open an investigation  on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted.In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-Elect Trump s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone)   once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months   three in person and six on the phone.January 27 DinnerThe President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others.It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks.The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away.My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI s traditionally independent status in the executive branch.I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not  reliable  in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President.A few moments later, the President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.  I didn t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because  problems  come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said,  I need loyalty.  I replied,  You will always get honesty from me.  He paused and then said,  That s what I want, honest loyalty.  I paused, and then said,  You will get that from me.  As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase  honest loyalty  differently, but I decided it wouldn t be productive to push it further. The term   honest loyalty   had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.As was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI.February 14 Oval Office MeetingOn February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the semi-circle of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs.The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me.When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying,  I want to talk about Mike Flynn.  Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information   a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed.The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying,  He is a good guy and has been through a lot.  He repeated that Flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said,  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  I replied only that  he is a good guy.  (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would  let this go. The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President.I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI s role as an independent investigative agency.The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the President s request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney General s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role.After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members   or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them   aware of the President s request.Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the President s concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened   him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind   was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBI s potential investigation of General Flynn.March 30 Phone CallOn the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as  a cloud  that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to  lift the cloud.  I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week   at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me,  We need to get that fact out.  (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)The President went on to say that if there were some  satellite  associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren t investigating him.In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn t brought up  the McCabe thing  because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe s wife) campaign money. Although I didn t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.He finished by stressing  the cloud  that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later.April 11 Phone CallOn the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I  get out  that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that  the cloud  was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.He said he would do that and added,  Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.  I did not reply or ask him what he meant by  that thing.  I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.That was the last time I spoke with President Trump.",politics,"Jun 7, 2017",0
"'Stop whining' about U.S. elections being rigged, Obama tells Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama urged Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to “stop whining” about the Nov. 8 election being rigged, saying no serious person could suggest U.S. elections could be manipulated because of their decentralized nature. “I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place.

"BREAKING: Federal Judge STOPS Obamacare Transgender, Abortion Related Protections","O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they  have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule. WASHINGTON   A federal judge in Texas on Saturday issued a nationwide injunction halting enforcement of Obama administration protections for transgender and abortion-related healthcare services just one day before they were due to go into effect. The lawsuit   brought by Texas, a handful of other states, and some religiously affiliated nonprofit medical groups   challenges a regulation implementing the sex nondiscrimination requirement found in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Health and Human Services (HHS) regulation  forbids discriminating on the basis of  gender identity  and  termination of pregnancy  under Obamacare, as US District Court Judge Reed O Connor wrote in his opinion halting enforcement of those provisions in the rule.Specifically, the ACA provision   Section 1557   prohibits discrimination in federally-funded health benefits, including based on sex. Over the course of 2015 and this year, HHS proposed and finalized a regulation interpreting the definition of  sex  in that provisions to include  gender identity    defined as  internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female    as well as  sex stereotyping  and  termination of pregnancy. Explaining the lawsuit, O Connor wrote,  Plaintiffs claim the Rule s interpretation of sex discrimination pressures doctors to deliver healthcare in a manner that violates their religious freedom and thwarts their independent medical judgment and will require burdensome changes to their health insurance plans on January 1, 2017.  The states and nonprofits in the healthcare lawsuit allege that the regulation violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)   which sets the rules for federal government rule-making   and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they  have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule.  The White House defended the administration s policies on Saturday night.Read more: Buzzfeed",Government News,"Dec 31, 2016",0

U.S.-backed SDF to let Syrian Islamic State fighters leave Raqqa,"AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian Islamic State fighters are set to abandon Raqqa in a withdrawal agreed with U.S.-backed Syrian militias that have them surrounded, a militia spokesman said on Saturday, as the jihadists  defeat in their former Syrian capital edged closer. Officials gave conflicting accounts on whether foreign fighters would also be leaving the city, where the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been battling to defeat Islamic State since June. SDF spokesman Talal Silo said the foreign fighters would be left behind  to surrender or die , without saying when the evacuation of Syrian fighters would take place. But Omar Alloush, a member of Raqqa s Civil Council, said the evacuation would include foreign fighters. He said it would take place overnight into Sunday. The jihadists would be taking some 400 civilians with them as human shields, he said. The final defeat of IS at Raqqa would be a milestone in efforts to roll back the theocratic  caliphate  the group declared in 2014 in Syria and Iraq, where earlier this year it was driven from the city of Mosul. IS used Raqqa as a base to plan attacks against the West. The Kurdish YPG militia, which dominates the SDF, told Reuters earlier on Saturday that Islamic State was on the verge of defeat in Raqqa, and the city may finally be cleared of the jihadists on Saturday or Sunday.  The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State said a convoy was due to leave Raqqa on Saturday, in an arrangement agreed by local parties. It described the arrangement as  a civilian evacuation  and said it would not condone any arrangement that allowed  terrorists to escape Raqqa without facing justice .     Coalition spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon said the coalition s stance was that IS fighters must surrender unconditionally, but added that he could not comment on who would be in the convoy. He said difficult fighting was expected in the days ahead. The coalition statement said the arrangement brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and local Arab tribal elders on Oct. 12 was  designed to minimize civilian casualties and purportedly excludes foreign Daesh terrorists . The coalition believed the arrangement would  save innocent lives and allow Syrian Democratic Forces and the coalition to focus on defeating Daesh terrorists in Raqqa with less risk of civilian casualties , it said. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said the SDF had agreed to allow safe passage out of the city for Syrian Islamic State fighters still inside, and they were organizing a  mechanism  for them to leave. Its statement made no mention of the fate of Islamic State s foreign jihadists, but said the remaining fighters in the city were only  a small number besieged in one or more positions in the city, who have no choice but surrender or death . Alloush earlier told Reuters that the IS fighters would go to remaining territory held by the group in Syria. Negotiated withdrawals of combatants facing defeat have become a common feature of the six-year-long Syrian war.      An activist group that reports on Raqqa, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, said on its Facebook page that dozens of buses had entered Raqqa city overnight Friday from the countryside to the north. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based organization that reports on the war, said Syrian Islamic State fighters and their families had already left the city, and buses had arrived to evacuate remaining foreign fighters and their families.     The Syrian army, which is supported by Iran-backed militias and the Russian air force, declared another significant victory over Islamic State on Saturday, saying it had captured the town of al-Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province. The eastern province is Islamic State s last major foothold in Syria, and it is under attack there from the SDF on one side and Syrian government forces supported by Iran-backed militias and Russian air strikes on the other.  Islamic State fighters had previously agreed to an evacuation last August, from an area on the Syrian-Lebanese border. But as their convoy moved toward Islamic State-held territory in eastern Syria, coalition planes blocked its route by cratering roads, destroying bridges and attacking nearby Islamic State vehicles.

"Canada proposes health warnings, child-proof packs for legal pot sales","OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government proposed on Tuesday mandatory health warnings and child-proof packaging as well as a licensing regime for all cannabis products in legislation ahead of the July 2018 legalization of recreational marijuana. The proposals, which will be open for public consultation for 60 days, include restrictions on packaging to ensure the products are not enticing to children as well as legal standards for quality control and potency, Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor told reporters. The government is on track to legalize recreational marijuana by July 2018, making it the first Group of Seven country to do so. Petitpas Taylor said the government wants to set strict guidelines for the safety of cannabis products, but ensure micro-producers and big companies alike will have access to the market as long as they are licensed.  We want to make sure the market will be open to everyone. Some people will be small businesses and they can certainly apply for a license in order to have a micro-industry, if you will,  she told reporters, adding there is no limit to the number of licenses that will be available. The proposed regulations address the licensing, tracking, packaging and labeling of recreational and medical marijuana practices, and include a permitting regime for the cultivation, processing, sale, testing and import and export of cannabis. The federal government earlier this month proposed splitting with the provinces income from excise taxes on recreational marijuana, drawing criticism from Ontario, which is concerned it will face higher costs associated with the new law.  The federal government said it wants an excise tax on all cannabis products, including medical marijuana, of C$1 per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher. Some provinces have asked the government to delay legalization, saying they need more time to set up a sales system and train police officers who will be enforcing the new rules. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the issue part of his 2015 successful election campaign and the Liberal government says regulating marijuana will keep it out of the hands of underage users and reduce drug-related crime. Shares of licensed producers, such as Canopy Growth, have soared in anticipation of legalization but the stocks are expected to face a bumpy ride in 2018. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

 Jared Kushner’s Excuse For The Russian Meeting Would Get Most People Fired,"Imagine your boss or a client sends you an email informing you of a meeting. What do you do? Do you read the entire email so you ll be prepared or do just guess and wing it? You d probably read the email so you re prepared. Jared Kushner, though, who is supposedly a very successful businessman, apparently just wings it   at least according to his defense in regards to the Russian meetings.Kushner wasn t the original recipients of the emails that arranged the meeting at Trump tower with the very clear agenda of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton, but he was forwarded the emails. Now a source is saying he didn t read the part about the Russians, despite the fact that the subject line read:  Re: Russia   Clinton   private and confidential. In the emails, the contact, a former tabloid reporter called Rob Goldstone, said the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a  Russian government attorney  who could provide  very high level and sensitive information  as  part of Russia and its government s support for Mr Trump. But a source close to the situation told BuzzFeed that Mr Kushner did not read to the bottom of the email, missing out key words like  Russian government  and therefore did not realise what the meeting was about.Source: IndependentOh, and the defense gets worse. According to the source, Kushner only attended the meeting to talk about Russian adoptions. There was no mention of Russian adoptions at all in the email chain.Not coincidentally, Donald Trump s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, also claimed that he was innocent because he didn t read the whole thing.What makes it even more difficult to believe Kushner is that he s already proven himself a consummate liar.

"Saudi Prince Lectures America On Democracy, Calling For ‘NEVER TRUMP’","21st Century Wire says Well, isn t this interesting. Saudi Arabian princes are giving lessons in democracy?Incredible. The headline reads:  Saudi Prince Begs America to Reject Trump. In summary: here we have a hereditary monarch, from a Wahabi theocratic dictatorship now lecturing Americans on who they should vote for in their elections.  During his recent dinner speech at the Washington Institute For Near East Policy at the Mandarin Oriental hotel, Prince Turki- al-Faisal (photo, below), a graduate of Georgetown University, made his passionate plea to the American electorate not to elect Donald J. Trump as president.NOTE: The word  election  is a treasonous concept in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and if you are ever caught asking for it   you will not only be jailed, but will likely face capital punishment. The Mail Online reported:A Saudi prince has urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election. Turki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday.He blasted Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says,  These people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,  Turki said according to the Huffington Post.Prince Turki currently serves as the chairman of the Saudi Arabian-funded Washington DC-based think tank,  King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies.  Interestingly, the Saudi Prince was sharing his Washington DC event stage with none other than Israeli general Yaakov Amidror, the former national security advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Amidror presided over a number of violent operations against the native Palestinian population, including the slaughter of over 500 civilians in Gaza in 2012Whether or not one likes (or loathes) the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee, it s important to consider the Prince s comments in perspective So who is a greater threat to peace and stability in the Middle East and Central Asia, and elsewhere   Donald Trump or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? Let s quickly examine some of Saudi Arabia s  progressive  and democratic credentials.Oil-based MonarchyThe current ruling family in Saudi Arabia, the House of Saud, was installed into power by the British in the early 20th century. Since the development of Saudi Arabia s oil fields, mainly by US and UK firms, tribal elites have had the luxury of having  money on tap , amounting to many trillions of dollars in continuous energy revenue, with almost all of the wealth channeled into the hands of hereditary and royal elites. Saudi s repression of democracy is not limited to its own borders, however. When a true  Arab Spring  event broke out in neighboring Bahrain in 2011, Saudi Arabia deployed its army to put down any popular uprising, and still patrols those streets today.More recently, their vast oil fortunes have been channeled into building-up a militarized state, and recently, with the backing of the US and PR cover by the UN, have openly waged war on its neighbor, Yemen.Regressive SocietyEven in the 21st century, Saudi Arabia still manages to win the near submissive support of the US and the UK, despite the fact that it is running an openly regressive, medieval theocratic autocracy, where hundreds of its citizens are executed in the street, many via beheading. Last year, in 2015, was a record year for beheadings under the newly crowned King Salman. PATRONAGE: President Obama paying tribute to the new King Salman of Saudi Arabia.No Religious FreedomThe Kingdom is also actively repressing its own native Shi ite population, as well as others who are not born into the right royaly-favored religion or tribe.  Practicing Christianity is also forbidden in the Kingdom and any attempted conversion from Islam is punishable by death.Genocidal Military StateFor the last 14 months, and with the assistance of the US, Saudi Arabia and its GCC allies have been waging an illegal and highly brutal military war of aggression against its neighbor Yemen   killing tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians and displacing millions more.World s Premier Supporter of Islamic Extremism and TerrorismHistorically, it is now accepted as fact that Saudi Arabia the world s leading financial supporter of Islamic extremist terrorism in the Middle East and beyond. This has been the case for many decades starting from the Kingdom s central role, together with the CIA and others, in supporting Mujadhedin militants and al Qaeda in Afghanistan from the late 1970 s and all the way through to their involvement in 9/11. This trend continues today, with Saudi, along with its tribal monarch cousin, Qatar, as the primary source of funding and support for terrorist fighting groups like Jabhat Al Nusra (al Qaeda in Syria) and also Islamic State (ISIS), as well as a direct financier of radical Mosques all over the world.Saudi Nuclear Weapon PlansIn the same interview this week, Prince Turki also dropped  another bomb , so to speak, by announcing Saudi Arabia s somewhat disturbing ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons:Saudi Arabia has accepted the Iran nuclear deal, which lasts 10-15 years, Prince Turki said. But what happens after that is  open to question. That s why I ve always maintained that we   must consider all options, including the acquisition of nuclear weapons,  the prince added   though he emphasized his preference for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region.So who is the real threat in the region and beyond? One thing should be certain by now   it s not Iran, or Donald Trump.READ MORE SAUDI NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Saudi Arabia Files",US_News,"May 9, 2016",0

The ads feature transgender New Yorkers and encourage residents to “look past pink and blue,” among other messages. In March, de Blasio signed an executive order ensuring that transgender people can use the bathroom of their choice in any city-owned building without being asked for identification by employees. City law already allows transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. “While other cities and states are legislating intolerance and taking away individuals’ right to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity, we are proudly standing with our transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. President Barack Obama’s administration in May released guidance telling public schools across the United States that they must allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. The letter, which offered the U.S. government’s interpretation of anti-discrimination law, contained the implicit threat of cutting off federal funding for schools that do not comply.  Officials from more than a dozen states have either sued or plan to sue the Obama administration, challenging the directive as unconstitutional. North Carolina and the U.S. Department of Justice exchanged federal lawsuits last month over the state’s law banning people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their gender of their birth.

"LEFTIST MEDIA DESTROYED Mike Flynn, Cracked Jokes After Horrible LIE Obama’s National Security Advisor Told Media, Families Of Benghazi Victims [VIDEO]","Fun fact: While Trump press secretary Sean Spicer fielded 55 questions on February 14 related to the Flynn debacle, Obama s press secretary Jay Carney received only 13 questions from reporters on September 12, 2012, three of which were set-ups to blast Mitt Romney s criticism of the administration after the attack. 55 to 13.So as we now suffer through yet another patch of media mania, conspiracy theories, and unsubstantiated claims about how Trump hearts Russia, as well as the daily beatings endured by Spicer, let s reminisce to when the media and Obama s press flaks spun, deflected even joked about golf and  Saturday Night Live! less than a week after Benghazi.Buried deep beneath the Michael Flynn hysteria this week was Judicial Watch s release of newly obtained State Department documents related to the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. One email confirms again that the Obama administration knew the day after the attack it was not a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video. That was the excuse shamefully propagated by top Obama administration officials (including the president himself) and swallowed whole by a media establishment desperate to help Obama win re-election six weeks later.According to the summary of a call on September 12, 2012 between State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy and several congressional staffers, Kennedy was asked if the attack came under cover of protest:  No this was a direct breaching attack,  he answered. Kennedy also denied the attack was coordinated with the protests in Cairo over the video:  Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint. But of course nothing matches the audacity of trope by Obama s National Security Advisor Susan Rice on September 16, 2012. Rice went on several Sunday shows to peddle a story she knew was completely phony, one that was already quickly unraveling even as most in the media and administration tried to keep it intact.Rice repeats the line that Benghazi attack was not premediated and was connected to the demonstrations in Cairo over the video (a document obtained by Judicial Watch last year shows Hillary Clinton met with Rice a few days before her television appearances). Which presidential administration is fact-challenged, again?In a press gaggle on Air Force One the next day, guess how many times Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about Rice s comments? Ten? Five? One? Not once. Let me repeat that. The day after Obama s national security advisor was on five news programs to blame a terrorist attack on a YouTube video, not one reporter asked the White House about it. I actually had to re-read the transcripts several times, even checking the date over and over, to make sure this was accurate. Her name did not even come up.No discussion about the investigation. No discussion about emerging evidence from around the world that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack. (The only time it was mentioned was when Jen Psaki criticized Mitt Romney s comments about how the administration handled Benghazi and questioned whether he was ready for  primetime. )Here s what they did discuss: Debate prep, Occupy Wall Street, and the Chicago s teachers strike. An actual human reporter asked this:  It was a beautiful weekend for golf and he wasn t out on the course. Is it safe to assume maybe he was doing some preparation at the White House?  WHAT? Then they joked about football and  Saturday Night Live.   The FederalistWatch here as Susan Rice intentionally lies her way around the different TV networks and Trey Gowdy blasts the double standard of our media:Here is US Ambassador to the UN, who was elevated to Obama s National Security Advisor after she lied to the media and to the American people about Benghazi protests being sparked by a video.

"Smaller EU states need stronger voice, not Brussels, says Czech election favorite","VARNSDORF, Czech Republic (Reuters) - The Czech Republic and smaller states like it should have a stronger voice in the European Union, not Brussels officials, the billionaire frontrunner in next month s parliamentary election said. Andrej Babis, head of the poll-leading ANO party, has been a critic of the EU s migration policy and says Prague should not adopt the common currency until the euro zone sorts itself out. Neighboring Hungary and Slovakia strongly oppose EU plans for migrant resettlement quotas for each member state, calling instead for stronger border controls. Babis has taken a similar tough line on the issue heading into the Oct. 20-21 election. In a campaign trail interview, Babis said member states needed more powers at the expense of the bloc s executive, led by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.  And he took shots at French President Emmanuel Macron, who has accused eastern member states of treating the EU like a  supermarket .   The heads of government and presidents must have stronger power and not Mr Juncker,  Babis told Reuters on Thursday in Varnsdorf, a town on the German border.  Mr Juncker s ideas are off the mark and that is also why the EU is viewed badly. (The EU) is a great project, we certainly need to stay in Europe, but we have to play a more active role.  The real solution to the migrant influx was to solve the conflicts driving people to flee their countries.  We will not solve the migration problem without solving problems in Libya or Syria,  he said. He said Brussels could not force member states to accept its policies.   I do not think there is a core Europe and that we are on the sidelines,  he said.  We need to fight for our Czech national interests.  Babis s ANO party, in a Social Democrat-led government since 2014, has a double-digit poll lead, putting him on course to be the next prime minister. But he is facing possible police charges that he abused EU subsidies almost a decade ago while heading his food, chemicals and media company Agrofert. Other parties say Babis should not  be in the next government if charged. Babis told Reuters the investigation was a political ploy, saying there was no reason he should not be in the next government. The Czech Republic has enjoyed solid growth in recent years and has the lowest unemployment in the EU. Wages are rising fast and the state posted its first budget surplus for 21 years in 2016. Babis was finance minister from 2014 until this May.  The businessman, who has placed his assets in a trust fund to meet conflict-of-interest legislation, said the state could be run more efficiently and could help the economy fulfil its potential. He said it was a paradox that EU states which failed to meet the bloc s rules limiting budget deficits, like France, were not punished.  Macron irked eastern states in June by saying countries could not pick and choose which EU rules they followed, referring to clashes including over the policy on migrants.  He is commenting on eastern Europe (but) should concentrate on France,  Babis said. The Czech Republic pledged when it joined the EU in 2004 to eventually adopt the euro. Babis asked why Czechs should be on the hook for Greece s debts.  In this moment it is not beneficial. I certainly don t want the euro,  he said.

Ukraine's Poroshenko suggests IMF-backed anti-graft court will take time,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Friday said he hoped an anti-corruption chamber would be created next month, but expressed doubt that an independent court as envisaged by the International Monetary Fund could be set up before 2019. Under its $17.5 billion aid-for-reforms program, the IMF wants Ukraine to set up a special court to focus on tackling corruption, which remains entrenched. But Poroshenko said it would take time to establish this kind of institution.  I hope we create an anti-corruption chamber next month and then, if an anti-corruption court would be created in 2019, 2020 - welcome!,  Poroshenko said at the opening of the annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) conference. The proposal of an anti-corruption chamber in existing courts has previously been criticized by reform activists, who say the body would not be sufficiently independent. Poroshenko s comments are at odds with the views of the IMF s first deputy managing director, David Lipton, who visited Kiev this week to meet the authorities and said an anti-corruption court should be a priority.  We certainly agree that the creation of an anti-corruption court is an important next step. We encourage the government to do that,  Lipton was quoted on Friday as telling newspaper Ukrainska Pravda in an interview. Ukraine has received $8.4 billion from the IMF, helping it recover from a two-year recession following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the outbreak of a Russian-backed insurgency in its industrial east. But further disbursements depend in part on the adoption of pension reform, a review of gas prices and the creation of an anti-corruption judicial body. Some of these requirements face stiff opposition from populist lawmakers.  There are risks of going backwards,  Lipton said, referring to Ukraine s progress under the IMF program. He said it was too early to forecast when Ukraine could receive the next tranche of loans.  First, we need to see the reforms that are needed for this review to be implemented.  He said the focus of this review was pension reform and measures to speed up privatization and ensure concrete results in anti-corruption efforts. Fiscal and energy sector policies must remain consistent with the program also. ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1
 Trump Directly Begs Twitter Fans For Money In Unprecedented Desperation (TWEET),"It s no secret that Trump s campaign isn t exactly raking in the donations. After all, no one wants to risk being tied to a racist xenophobe who is running the biggest con job the American people have ever seen and pretending it s a presidential campaign. Trump is being outspent by Hillary Clinton in a stunning 15-1 margin, and it doesn t seem that he s able to do anything about that right now. To that end, what s an orange dictator-in-the-making to do when his opponent s campaign is so much more competent and well-funded? When it s Donald Trump, there s just one answer to that question: Tweet.Trump has decided to literally beg his many fans on Twitter for money to fund his campaign. Invoking his  Crooked Hillary  theme, he tweeted out to all the neo-Nazis, Klan members, misogynists, and other assorted bigots that litter his cesspool of a Twitter feed:To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign.

 Racists Lose Their Minds After Mexican-American Teen Sings National Anthem At Dem Debate (TWEETS)," Wednesday night was the final Democratic debate before the March 15 Primaries, and it was heated. However, the biggest controversy of the night didn t come from the candidates sparring with each other. It came when a Mexican-American teenager sang the National Anthem at the beginning of the debate. Apparently, white America believes only Caucasians are allowed to sing that song.Fifteen-year-old Sebastien de la Cruz took the stage before the debate and sang a beautiful rendition of our national song. He has an amazing voice for someone so young and of course, given the fact that it was a Univision debate, it made sense that a Latino/a give the performance. Racists, however, weren t interested in praising the child for his vocal abilities or using common sense; instead, they decided to spew hate all over Twitter, because they are a$$holes.Here are some of their responses: .CNN this is the dumbest thing I ve quite possibly ever saw. For a minute I forgot I was in #America until they sang the national anthem.

In 2013, the then 13-year-old sang the  Star-Spangled Banner  before Game 3 of the NBA finals and the scummiest Americans reacted in the same way. They called him all sorts of names, but his response was perfect:  My father was actually in the [U.S.] Navy for a really long time,  De La Cruz told San Antonio Fox 29 in an interview about the backlash.  People don t know; they just assume that I m just Mexican. But I m not from Mexico. I m from San Antonio, born and raised, a true San Antonio Spurs fan. Fortunately, the positive comments far outweighed the negative this time around. Sadly, though, he will probably always be the target of scumbags who hate him just because his skin is tanner than theirs.

Court says Republican gerrymandering in Wisconsin was unconstitutional,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republicans in Wisconsin tilted district maps in their favor in order to hamper Democrats and ultimately win state elections in 2012 and 2014, a federal court said on Monday in a case that could influence future rulings on gerrymandering. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin decided 2-1 that Act 43, a redrawing of districts approved by the state’s Republican-led legislature in 2012, violated the U.S. Constitution, court documents showed.  “We find that the discriminatory effect is not explained by the political geography of Wisconsin nor is it justified by a legitimate state interest,” the court wrote in its ruling. The case has no bearing on Donald Trump’s victory in Wisconsin in the presidential election on Nov. 8, in which he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement that he planned to appeal, which would send the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. A ruling there on gerrymandering - the practice of manipulating electoral boundaries for political advantage - could have wide implications across the country as similar cases in Maryland and North Carolina work their way through lower courts.     “This is a big victory for those who want to see courts rein in partisan gerrymandering. But it is anybody’s guess what happens to this when it gets to the Supreme Court,” wrote Richard Hasen, an elections law expert at the University of California, Irvine, on his blog. Since 2010, Republicans have more than doubled their control of state legislatures. They now control both legislative chambers in a record 32 states, the New York Times reported. “Republicans win elections because we have better candidates and a better message that continues to resonate with the voters,” said Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in a statement. Twelve Wisconsin voters argued in their lawsuit that Republicans redrew maps in 2011 to divide Democratic voters so they fall short of a majority in districts and to concentrate Democratic voters into districts so they win by overwhelming margins and dilute votes of Democrats statewide, according to the ruling.   Despite receiving 51 percent of the votes statewide in 2012, Democrats won only 39 of 99 Assembly seats. In 2014, Republicans won roughly the same percentage of votes statewide, but won 63 seats, a 24-seat disparity, judges wrote.  The Wisconsin case hinged on a new way to measure the discriminatory effect of gerrymandering. The “efficiency gap” measure found the redistricting in Wisconsin caused Democrats to waste more votes than Republicans.     The measure gives judges “a clear threshold for deciding what is acceptable”, Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the New York Times.

"FBI: Clinton Foundation investigation will lead to ‘Likely Indictment,’ donors funded ISIS","21st Century Wire says Yesterday we learned that for more than one year the FBI s White Collar Crime Division has actually been investigating a pay-for-play activity between Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The investigation has been going on for more than a year. According FOX anchor Bret Baier, multiple FBI sources said,  indictments are likely. This could get very interesting A number of new revelations could really raise the temperature on this scandal:Last night, an RT Exclusive revealed what Julian Assange described as, the most significant email in the whole collection. Conveniently ignored by the mainstream media, WikiLeaks had previously highlighted an early 2014 email where outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging John Podesta, then an advisor to President Barack Obama, to  bring pressure  on Qatar and Saudi Arabia,  which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.  Yes. You read that correctly: the Clinton Foundation was accepting millions of dollars in donations from the very Gulf states she knew were funding ISIS and Al Nusra terrorists   thus exposing the charade the Clinton and the Obama Administration have been playing ever since the  ISIS crisis  began in June 2014.Fox News Channel s Bret Baier reported on the latest details of the Clinton Foundation investigation from two sources inside the FBI. He reveals five important new pieces of information in these two short clips:1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. 2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. 3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton s secret server on Anthony Weiner s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. 4. Sources within the FBI have told Baier that an indictment is  likely  in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation,  barring some obstruction in some way  from the Justice Department. 5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information has  been taken from it.(Source: Real Clear Politics) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2iIr6ugheQ . Conclusion: Limbaugh took his postiion many days ago, and based on the potential gravity of Assange s recent Clinton-ISIS email revelation   this looks to be a compelling smoking gun.

"Yemen Houthis say Sanaa airport repaired, ready to receive flights: agency","ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen s Sanaa airport, damaged in an air strike by a Saudi-led coalition last week, has been repaired and is ready to receive international flights, the Houthi-led government which runs the capital city said on Tuesday. The Nov. 14 raid destroyed radio navigation equipment at the airport and in effect put the facility out of service. The attack happened after the coalition banned naval, air and land transportation to Yemen following a missile fired by the Houthis that was shot down over the Saudi capital Riyadh. The transport minister in the Houthi-run government, Zakariya al-Shami, said that technical civil aviation teams had completed implementation of technical alternatives necessary to restore services to the airport .  It is ready to receive international flights,  Shami said, according to Houthi-controlled news agency Saba. The airport had been mainly used by international relief agencies, including U.N. staff, using United Nations flights to Sanaa. The coalition has said that all Yemeni land crossings, air and sea ports would remain closed until assurances are made that no weapons can reach the Houthis. The coalition accuses Iran of smuggling weapons, including the missile fired towards Riyadh airport on Nov. 4, to the Houthis through Yemeni ports controlled by the group. Iran denies sending any weapons to the Houthis. The closure of Yemen s ports, including the main Hodeidah port where most of the country s food supplies enter, has raised alarm around the world. The European Union on Tuesday urged the Saudi-led coalition to reopen Yemen s ports and airports.  While fully recognizing the serious security threat incoming from Yemen, it is our firm belief that hindering vital humanitarian access to the Yemeni population that is already on the brink of famine and subject to a spreading cholera outbreak will not effectively address these security concerns,  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.

"China says one step forwards, two steps back no good for Japan ties","BEIJING (Reuters) - China s foreign minister on Thursday said that ties with Japan should not take two steps back for every step forward, after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a rare appearance at an anniversary event for the normalization of diplomatic relations. Speaking on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the resumption of ties between Beijing and Tokyo, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Japan s ambassador to China, Yutaka Yokoi, that he hoped for greater improvement in relations.  We hope that the Japanese government can pursue a more positive policy towards China... and not take one step back for each step forward, even two steps back for each step forward,  Wang said, according to a statement released on the ministry website on Friday.

Congress votes to call on Trump to denounce hate groups,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Congress passed a resolution late on Tuesday calling on President Donald Trump to condemn hate groups after Trump was criticized for his response to the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a month ago. The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously adopted the resolution, U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said in a statement. The Senate approved the measure on Monday. “Tonight, the House of Representatives spoke in one unified voice to unequivocally condemn the shameful and hate-filled acts of violence carried out by the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville,” Connolly said. The joint resolution, passed with the support of both Republicans and Democrats, will go to Trump for his signature.  Representatives for the White House did not respond immediately to an email seeking comment. The Congressional resolution calls on Trump to condemn hate groups and what it describes as the growing prevalence of extremists who support anti-Semitism, xenophobia and white supremacy. It also urges Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate acts of violence and intimidation by white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups. Trump alienated fellow Republicans, corporate leaders and U.S. allies and rattled markets last month with comments about the violence in Charlottesville, where white nationalists and neo-Nazis clashed with anti-racism activists on Aug. 12. One woman, Heather Heyer, was killed and several people were wounded when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into anti-racist demonstrators. The Congressional resolution calls Heyer’s death a “domestic terrorist attack.” James Alex Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio man who authorities say drove into Heyer and other protesters, has been charged with second-degree murder and other criminal counts.  On Aug. 12, Trump denounced hatred and violence “on many sides,” a comment that drew sharp criticism from across the political spectrum for not condemning white nationalists.  White nationalists had gathered in Charlottesville to protest against the planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led the pro-slavery Confederacy’s army during the U.S. Civil War. Trump defended Confederate monuments last month. At a rally in Phoenix on Aug. 22, Trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville. “I didn’t say I love you because you’re black, or I love you because you’re white,” Trump said at the rally. “I love all the people of our country.” The resolution also acknowledged the deaths of two Virginia State Police officers whose helicopter crashed as they patrolled the Charlottesville protest.

OOPS…CDC EMPLOYEES SICK OF DEALING WITH INFLUX OF ILLEGAL MINORS SENDS EMAIL ABOUT OBAMA: “the worst prez we have ever had…a marxist”,"I guess we re not the only ones who are 100% FED UP with our marxist president Following the influx of illegal immigrant minors from Central America, an official at the federal agency charged with protecting public health describes Barack Obama as  the worst pres we have ever had,  an  amateur  and  Marxist,  according to internal emails obtained by Judicial Watch.JW got the records as part of an investigation into the Center for Disease Control s (CDC) activation of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to deal with the barrage of illegal alien minors last summer. Tens of thousands of Central Americans came into the United States through the Mexican border and contagious diseases many considered to be eradicated in the U.S. became a tremendous concern. The CDC, which operates under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), responded by opening an emergency facility designed to monitor and coordinate response activities to eminent public health threats. This special emergency division was created after the 2001 terrorist attacks and has responded to more than 50 public health threats, including hurricanes, food borne disease outbreaks, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the Haiti cholera outbreak. Scientists from across the CDC are brought together to analyze, validate, and efficiently exchange information during a public health emergency and connect with response partners. The EOC also coordinates the deployment of CDC staff and the procurement and management of all equipment and supplies that agency responders may need during their deployment.[ ]It s a major and costly operation that can stick American taxpayers with a huge tab. That s why JW launched a probe when the Obama administration took in the illegal immigrants, initially coined Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC), with open arms last summer. JW has sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for planning records involving the border crisis as well as information relating to the solicitation of  on-demand escort services  for the 65,000 UACs that remain in the U.S. Last year JW also reported that the illegal immigrant minors have brought in serious diseases, including swine flu, dengue fever, possibly Ebola virus and tuberculosis.The CDC records obtained by JW this week include email exchanges between agency officials directly involved in the activation of the EOC to handle the health threats created by the influx of illegal alien minors last summer. In an email dated June 9, 2014, CDC Logistics Management Specialist George Roark wrote to CDC Public Health Advisor William Adams that  no country in the world would allow  the influx. Adams replies that  in ten years or less, they ll all be voting Commander s intent  Roark fires back by describing Obama as  the worst pres we have ever had he truly is  the amateur  but a Marxist too.

MN: SOMALI MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS Explain Why It’s Acceptable To Kill Anyone Who Insults Mohammed [VIDEO],"Ami Horowitz is a thought provoking filmmaker who took a lot of heat for exposing the truth about the horrific, violent  no-go zones  in Sweden in one of his recent documentary films. Horowitz is also very controversial because he doesn t shy away from asking tough questions of the people he randomly interviews on the streets.In fiscal year 2014, Minnesota took in 2,232 refugees, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. Almost half of those were from Somalia.In the video below, Ami took to the streets in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN to talk a variety of Somali Muslim immigrants. Ami posed several questions to a large variety of random Somali Muslim immigrants. He asked young boys, teenagers, middle-aged men and even an older woman their thoughts on how they felt about living in the United States, and if they d rather living back in Somalia. Horowitz also asked if they would prefer to live under Sharia Law or American laws. Their answers may surprise you.The most shocking part of the video however, comes near the end when Horowitz begins to discuss freedom of speech in America. While one of the men being interviewed talks about how great it is to be in America and to be afforded rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, every single Muslim respondent believed that free speech is great unless it involves criticizing the prophet Mohammed. Horowitz took his question a step further and asked if was okay for Muslims to use violence against someone who disparaged or insulted Mohammed. Every Muslim he asked, believed that using violence, including killing a person who criticized or mocked Mohammed, would be justified.Watch:After a major dip in 2008, the year ly num bers of new So ma li refu gees in Minnesota have re bounded stead i ly.

CHANGING HIS TUNE: THE MAN WHO WAS IN THE POLICE VAN WITH FREDDIE GRAY BREAKS HIS SILENCE,"So now that this guy fears for his life he s backtracking on the story he told or is he?This is such a mess and so convoluted that I doubt we ll ever get answers. This entire thing really is a sideshow to the bigger agenda of the Obama administration. Federalizing the police force is next From the beginning, the investigation into what killed Freddie Gray has centered on what happened inside the police transport van. We knew there was another prisoner inside the van and tonight we hear from him. WJZ s Mike Schuh is the first to speak with Donta Allen about what he heard. I am Donta Allen. I am the one who was in the van with Freddie Gray,  Allen said. The one who the police commissioner calls the second prisoner in the van.  The second prisoner who was picked up said that he didn t see any harm done to Freddie at all,  Commissioner Anthony Batts said.  What he has said is that he heard Freddie thrashing about.  But Allen wants to set something straight.  All I did was go straight to the station, but I heard a little banging like he was banging his head,  he said. He tells WJZ he s angry about an internal police report published in The Washington Post.  And they trying to make it seem like I told them that, I made it like Freddie Gray did that to hisself (sic),  Allen said.  Why the [expletive] would he do that to hisself (sic)?  Allen was in the van because he allegedly stole a cigarette from a store on North Avenue. He was never charged. Instead he was brought straight to the station.  I talked to homicide. I told homicide the same story.  Allen said. A story he says is being distorted and now he fears being killed.  I had two options today right, either come and talk to y all and get my credibility straight with ya ll and not get killed by these [expletive] or not tell a true story,  Allen added.  The only reason I m doing this is because they put my name in a bad state.  His statements are included in a police report that was today turned over to the city state s attorney Marilyn Mosby.

Ex-Marine chosen to direct U.S. extradition efforts,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has hired a retired Marine Corps major general to head the office in charge of bringing overseas criminal defendants to the United States for trial, a task that has grown in importance as the work of U.S. prosecutors increasingly crosses national borders. Vaughn Ary, a lawyer who was in the Marine Corps for 28 years, has been chosen as director of the department’s Office of International Affairs, according to an internal personnel announcement seen by Reuters.  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the appointment. Ary could not be reached for comment.  Ary resigned last year as the convening authority for U.S. military commissions, a job that put him in charge of operations at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, tribunals. He had angered some defense lawyers and military judges by pushing a plan to increase the pace of trials at the Guantanamo naval base by requiring judges to live there. The plan was scrapped. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs is in the middle of negotiating the extradition of drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman from Mexico. In another case, it has asked countries such as Switzerland and Honduras to hand over defendants in a sweeping investigation of corruption in soccer and its world governing body, FIFA.  The office is also charged with negotiating the transfer of evidence across borders through agreements known as mutual legal assistance treaties. More resources are going toward the office as a result of the increase in workload, Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said on Friday in a speech at a legal conference in San Diego. Caldwell said she was “very excited” about a new director of the Office of International Affairs, and said that the person would start on Monday. She did not name the person.

 Report: Black Women Have Become The Most Educated Group In The U.S. (VIDEO),"According to The National Center for Education Statistics, black women have recently emerged as the most educated population of people by race and gender in the United States. That makes them a powerful force in the political and business world.The NCES found that: From 1999 2000 to 2009 10, the percentage of degrees earned by females remained between approximately 60 and 62 percent for associate s degrees and between 57 and 58 percent for bachelor s degrees. In contrast, the percentages of both master s and doctor s degrees earned by females increased from 1999 2000 to 2009 10. Within each racial/ethnic group, women earned the majority of degrees at all levels in 2009 10. For example, among U.S. residents, Black females earned 68 percent of associate s degrees, 66 percent of bachelor s degrees, 71 percent of master s degrees, and 65 percent of all doctor s degrees awarded to Black students. The number of degrees that have been awarded to racial minorities in the United States has been on the rise for the past two decades. No, that doesn t mean that racial minorities are trying to take over the U.S. as I am sure many white supremacists would claim. It just means that many of the barriers that prevented black women from getting an education have begun to recede.Many people may have missed the notice due to the overwhelming amount of negative portrayals of black women in the media. According to a report in Essence from 2013, negative depictions of black women occur twice as likely as positive depictions of black women.This news comes with some caveats. Despite being the most educated bloc of people in the United States, black women are still making far less money than their white peers. There is also still only one black woman on the Forbes 500 list. That means that there is still a lot of work to be done to end the racial disparities in the United States.ATTN recently produced a video that gives a great rundown of the situation, you can watch it below.https://www.facebook.com/ATTNVideo/videos/1555955044709451/Featured image from (Photo by Erik S.

Far-right scores surprise success in Czech election,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - A far-right party whose leader wants to quit the EU and urged Czechs to walk pigs near mosques and stop eating kebabs, performed surprisingly well in an election, potentially giving it a chance to influence how the next government is formed. The Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party rode a wave of far-right sentiment in Europe in an election that ravaged the more established political parties and looked set to hand power to maverick tycoon Andrej Babis. The SPD was set up in 2015 by Tomio Okamura, a half-Japanese entrepreneur who made his name by creating an off-beat travel agency for cuddly toys before entering politics.  We want to stop any Islamisation of the Czech Republic, we push for zero tolerance of migration,  Okamura told reporters after his party won just under 10.7 percent of the vote, almost neck-and-neck with two other parties who were runners-up to Babis s ANO party. Okamura was first elected to the lower house for the Dawn party, which fought to install direct voting for most political posts and won 6.9 percent in the 2013 election, He was later ousted in a spat over irregularities in party finances. This time around, Okamura pounced on anti-foreigner feeling that has soared in the nation of 10.6 million, despite record-low unemployment, growing wages and relatively little immigration.   I voted for SPD because their opinions are close to mine, I am also against migrants arriving here,  said Pavel, an unemployed worker, leaving a polling station in Prague.  Okamura has also played on euroscepticism among many voters and attacked the Roma minority.  The European Union can t be reformed. It only dictates to us. We refuse the multicultural European superstate. Let s leave the EU,  Okamura said at a party leaders  debate just before polls opened on Friday. Born to a Czech mother and Japanese father, Okamura grew up in both the Czech Republic and Japan. He later sold popcorn at cinemas in Japan and ran a travel agency which took clients  plush toys around the sights of the Czech Republic. He was not always on the extreme right. Political analysts say he began courting voters with more hardline views after forming the SPD in 2015. In 2011, Okamura was on a jury at the Miss Expat beauty pageant, featuring immigrants to the country. Two years later he posted a picture of his Czech girlfriend wearing Islamic dress to enter a mosque in London as he praised the assistance she received there, calling it a  fine experience .   When he (Okamura) established his first party, he based it on direct democracy and punishment for bad politicians. Only after his ousting did he add the cheapest thing, the  virtual threat  of migration,  said Pavel Saradin, political science lecturer at the Palacky University in Olomouc. Saradin called the threat  virtual  as the Czech Republic was bypassed by the immigration wave seen elsewhere in Europe in the last two years and has only a tiny Muslim minority.  But the anti-immigrant message Okamura seized on has had wider backing in the Czech society, with all major political parties rejecting a quota system for redistributing migrants that have arrived in the European Union.  President Milos Zeman, formerly leader of the pro-European center-left Social Democrats, shared the podium with far-right anti-immigration activists during the 2015 celebrations of the country s democratic revolution. This weekend s election winner Babis, himself a rich businessman, will need partners to form a government.  Given that he faces fraud charges   which he says are trumped-up   several mainstream parties have already rejected being in government with him. This could potentially make an opening for the SPD which could supply its votes to back Babis s administration in return for policy concessions.  ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1

THE BRUTAL TRUTH ABOUT BENGHAZI: ’13 HOURS’ In-Home Sales BLOW UP Right Before The Election! Hillary Wants This GONE!

The movie, based on Mitchell Zuckoff s 2014 book 13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi, tells the story of the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya in which four Americans U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service s Sean Smith and CIA contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods   were killed by Islamist terrorists.Bay is directing the film from a script by Chuck Hogan (FX s The Strain). James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, Pablo Schreiber, Toby Stephens, David Denman, Max Martini, and Dominic Fumusa star.The trailer conveys a strong sense of dread before the classic Bay-inspired action kicks in. When everything went wrong, six men had the courage to do what was right,  the text in the trailer reads.With a budget reportedly in the range of $30-$40 million, Bay is working on 13 Hours with a lot less money than he usually gets to play with on blockbuster films like Transformers. Here s hoping the result is a return to form for Bay and a tight, focused action film that honors the memories of the American heroes who sacrificed their lives on that day.13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi hits theaters January 15.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jul 29, 2015",0
Trump to receive multiple options on Iran nuclear deal: Tillerson,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will be presented with multiple options regarding the future of the Iran nuclear deal ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline to certify whether Tehran is complying with the pact, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday. Tillerson did not disclose details about the kinds of options he will present to Trump. He also declined to directly answer a question about whether he shared Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  assessment to Congress on Tuesday that Iran was  fundamentally  in compliance with the accord.  We ll have a recommendation for the president. We re going to give him a couple of options of how to move forward to advance the important policy toward Iran,  Tillerson told reporters at the State Department. A collapse of the 2015 deal, which Trump has called  an embarrassment,  but which is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with Iran, could trigger a regional arms race and stoke Middle East tensions. A senior U.S. official said last month that Trump was leaning toward not certifying that Iran is complying with the pact. Trump himself has said he already had made up his mind whether to keep the pact, but has declined to disclose his decision. If Trump declines to certify Iran s compliance, U.S. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the accord. Unlike Mattis, who publicly suggested Trump should consider sticking with the agreement, Tillerson has been highly critical of the accord and said it must be changed. He has taken aim at the deal s so-called sunset clauses, under which some of the restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire over time. Tillerson on Wednesday suggested that whatever path the United States chooses on the nuclear accord known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), it would only represent one component of America s broader policy toward Iran.  The JCPOA represents only a small part of the many issues that we need to deal with when it comes to the Iranian relationship,  he said.  So it is an important part of that, but is not the only part. And I ve said many times, we cannot let the Iranian relationship be defined solely by that nuclear agreement.  ",worldnews,"October 4, 2017 ",1
AN ANGRY MARK LEVIN Writes a Letter to CNN Anchor Brian Stelter: “You are so thoroughly dishonest”,"I simply put together the stories that YOUR profession reported, on the public record. Do you deny there were two FISA applications? Do you deny the first was turned down? Do you deny the second was approved? It s called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. It is about surveillance. The fact that we cannot discern all the details because of the secrecy, except for what the media have revealed and selective leaks by the government, should cause you to want to know more, not to trash those who point it out.And yes, we can make several logical implications based on events and experience. A FISA application is a big deal. One, or two in this case, that involve campaign surrogates, or a server or computer related to a candidate or campaign, etc., is a big deal. President Obama s statement is not a definitive statement of anything, other than he, personally, did not order a wiretap, which I never claimed. But that does not mean he was unaware of surveillance activity by several of his departments, even through routine reports to the president, such as the Daily Intel Briefing or information conveyed to him or his staff via the Justice Department re the FBI counter-intelligence activities. As for Clapper, despite his past dissembling before Congress, he may not have been aware of what was taking place since the FBI counter-intel operation reportedly sought the warrant. The Daily Intel Briefing might provide useful information in that regard as well.Of course, the release of the FISA applications would also shed a lot of light on events, assuming YOU believe reports that they were filed.Furthermore, Clapper has said, as recently as yesterday, that no connections between the Russians and the Trump campaign have been found. I am extremely critical of Russia, Putin, and the efforts to influence our election, although I do not believe they succeeded. That said, how would Clapper know of no connections if he, as former Director of National Intelligence, didn t look? On what is that based?Your lack of curiosity and dishonesty about such matters and in dealing with me demean you and your profession. You are free to circulate this communication to whomever you wish, as I am making it public.",politics,"Mar 6, 2017",0
 How Fox News Helped Domestic Terrorists,"In the first year of President Obama s term in office, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning about the threat of domestic terrorism. Immediately, Fox News and the rest of the conservative media   Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and other talk radio figures   slammed the document and were soon followed by Republican members of congress.Overly sensitive to the hue and cry from the right in those early days, then Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano withdrew the report and the unit behind it was disbanded.Since then, America has had several instances of right-wing terrorism, from the South Carolina church shooting to the murder of police in Las Vegas and the Bundy clan s repeated armed run-ins with federal authorities.Daryl Johnson is the Homeland Security analyst who worked on the report, and he says that pull back has made things dangerous.On Friday, the department announced a task force with the Justice Department to focus on countering homegrown extremists radicalized by foreign groups such as the Islamic State, drawing staff members from dozens of federal and local agencies. It is unclear if the group would investigate domestic antigovernment groups. The D.H.S. is scoffing at the mission of doing domestic counterterrorism,  Mr. Johnson said.  The same patterns that led to the growth of the antigovernment groups in the 1990s is being played out today. D.H.S. should be doing more. In case you have forgotten the growth of those right wing groups in the 1990s   again, under a Democratic president they accused of  tyranny,  we had the Oklahoma City bombing, which until 9/11 was the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and is still the second most deadly attack of its kind. 169 people died and over 680 people were injured.Even worse, today s mainstream conservatives are espousing many of the radical ideas of the extremist movement. What once was way out on the fringe has now manifested in Republican lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Governor Greg Abbott calling for a  convention of the states,  echoing Confederate-era arguments about diluting the federal government and leaving more up to right-wing state governments.Thanks to Fox News browbeating the government into downplaying this very real threat to Americans, we could face a major loss of life.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 9, 2016",0
Factbox: Republican U.S. senators to watch in the debate on the tax bill,"(Reuters) - Republican Senator Rand Paul said on Monday he will vote for a tax bill headed to the U.S. Senate floor for debate this week, settling questions about his support for the measure, although several other senators’ positions on it were still uncertain. President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress want to pass tax legislation by the end of 2017. The House of Representatives has approved its own bill. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin, leaving little room for defections. Here is a list of Republicans whose votes could be pivotal to the bill’s fate. Paul, a fiscal hawk with a libertarian streak who sometimes strays from the party line, said on Monday he planned to vote for the tax bill, which was headed soon to the Senate floor. In a Fox News online opinion piece, Paul said the bill was not perfect and he would “prefer a larger cut,” but that he planned to back it because it achieved some of his goals and he could push for more changes next year. “I plan to vote for this bill as it stands right now,” wrote Paul, of Kentucky. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin surprised colleagues earlier this month by becoming the first Republican to announce opposition to the tax plan. That earned him a telephone call from Trump. Johnson, formerly chief executive of a polyester and plastics manufacturer, said the legislation unfairly helps corporations over small businesses. But he has said he hopes changes could be made to win his support. Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican, has said she has qualms about Senate leaders’ plan to include repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate in the tax bill. The mandate requires people to buy health insurance or face a penalty. Collins said her staff’s research showed that for some middle-class Americans, higher insurance costs stemming from repeal of the individual mandate would outweigh the benefits of the tax cuts they would receive. She was among three Republicans who voted in July to block a Republican attempt to dismantle Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Senator Bob Corker, a Trump critic who has decided not to run for re-election, has not taken a position on the tax bill. As a deficit hawk, Corker’s main concern is red ink - the tax bill is expected to add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years. Corker and Trump have openly feuded in recent weeks, with Corker calling the White House an “adult day care center” after Trump attacked Corker repeatedly on Twitter.     Senator John McCain of Arizona, a maverick and former presidential nominee, says he will wait for the final version of the tax-cut bill before announcing his position. The war hero infuriated Trump when he joined Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in voting against the Senate bill last summer to repeal Obamacare. McCain, who is still working after a diagnosis of brain cancer, has said he has almost no working relationship with  Trump and has criticized the administration. Murkowski of Alaska chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and wants to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, to oil and gas drilling. That provides an enticement for her to support the tax bill. Her committee has passed legislation to open the refuge to oil drilling, and the measure is expected to be attached to the tax bill. But Murkowski voted against three attempts to dismantle Obamacare in the summer, so the combination of the tax bill with a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate may give her pause. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a vocal Trump critic who is not seeking re-election in 2018, has issued a statement saying he appreciated the effort to fix the tax code but was worried about the impact on the national debt. Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, is a conservative Republican, like Flake. Lankford has been in talks with Flake and others about opposing the tax plan on the grounds that it would balloon the national deficit, Time magazine has reported.

 Reince Priebus Backs Trump’s Claim That The Media Is ‘The Enemy’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has declared war on the free press and his chief of staff apparently has his back. Appearing on Face the Nation this Sunday, Reince Priebus defended the tweeter in chief when it comes to his feud with the media.Trump has proclaimed the press to be  the enemy of the American people,  (through his Twitter account, of course) and Priebus thinks we should take this  seriously,  but for all the wrong reasons. CBS host John Dickerson asked Priebus about Trump naming the media the enemy in his tweet and the response he got was probably not what he was expecting. Well, I think you should take it seriously,  Priebus said.  I think that the problem we ve got is that we re talking about bogus stories like the one in the New York Times, that we ve had constant contact with Russian officials. The next day, the Wall Street Journal had a story that the intel community was not giving the president a full intelligence briefing. Both stories grossly inaccurate, overstated, overblown, and it s total garbage. The chief of staff continued, explaining that his biggest complaint about the media is their habit of protecting their sources and not outing them to the world. I think that the media should stop with this unnamed source stuff,  Priebus said.  Put names on a piece of paper and print it. If people aren t willing to put their name next to a quote, then the quote shouldn t be listed We re talking about stupidity and intelligence reporting that is based on facts that s not coming out of the actual heads of these intelligence agencies. And we re sitting here talking about it. And it s a shame. And it needs to end. Trump and his team are trying their best to convince the American people that the only place they can get the truth is from them. They are doing all they can to delegitimize the media and convince us that everything the press tells us is a lie. If the people don t trust the media, then there will be no one to bust them when the start spinning their  alternative facts  and this is precisely what the Trump administration wants.Here s the video:Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"February 19, 2017",0
Catalan standoff touches separatist hearts beyond Spain,"EDINBURGH/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The standoff between Madrid and supporters of independence in Spain s wealthy Catalan region has stirred separatist feelings far beyond the Spanish borders. Politicians across the globe criticized armed Spanish police who used truncheons and rubber bullets on voters, injuring hundreds in a crackdown on Sunday s secession vote, considered illegal under Spain s 1978 Constitution. Several politicians from regions with their own separatist movements said it was time for politics to resolve the crisis in the euro zone s fourth-biggest economy. Catalan leaders said the result showed its people wanted to leave Spain and it would push ahead with secession. Madrid has ruled out talks until, it said, Catalonia acts within the law.     The solution is political. It won t be through repression, it won t be through brutality, and what needs to happen is a political discussion. I think that s reality,  Quebec s premier Philippe Couillard told reporters.  He drew parallels for a potential solution to his own province, which has held two referendums on whether to separate from Canada and the last of which in 1995 was narrowly defeated. Other politicians called on the European Union, currently facing a huge challenge to its unity in Britain s impending exit from the bloc, to intervene in a deepening crisis that has shaken the euro and Spanish stocks and bonds. They said it was a matter of human rights.   Joanna Cherry, a lawmaker from the Scottish National Party, called on the EU to  up its game.  Her party lost a legally binding referendum on Scottish independence from the UK in 2014   the terms of which were hammered out between both sides.   The SNP-led Scottish government is urging talks to let Catalans decide their own future.   Spain will maintain that this vote is not legitimate, but the strength of feeling demonstrated cannot be ignored by Spain,  it said. Matt Carthy, European lawmaker for Irish nationalists Sinn Fein whose aim is to unite British-run Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic, called the EU  a shower of utter hypocrites.   The EU has ignored a vicious assault on EU citizens in Catalonia because they had the audacity to vote,  he told fellow European lawmakers in an emotionally-charged speech.  We are told the EU stands for peace, democracy and human rights. Where were those values on Sunday?   Opinion polls conducted before the Catalan vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of Catalans backed independence, but a majority wanted a referendum to be held. Catalan officials released preliminary referendum results showing 90 percent support in favor of breaking away, but turnout was 43 percent and low among those who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot.   Spain s constitution determines that the majority which counts is Spain as a whole, not Catalonia s 5.3 million voters. Ireland s prime minister Leo Varadkar has said his government respects Spain s constitution but he also described the violence as  disproportionate and counterproductive.  Spain s deputy prime minister and European Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans have said the use of force was  proportionate . Turkey, which condemned last week s referendum for Kurdish independence in northern Iraq, also spoke of the importance of respecting Spanish law and territorial integrity.  We believe that Spain ( ) will overcome such challenges and establish a national dialogue environment through a democratic approach,  Turkey s foreign ministry said.  In Serbia, officials accused the EU of double standards by refusing to recognize Catalonia s vote and at the same time supporting the independence of Serbia s former province Kosovo.  Another would-be breakaway group, the Movement for the Autonomy of Slask (RAS) which wants autonomy for Poland s Slask region, said that events in Spain were proof of the temptation to use repression to control political dissent.  The European community should work out rules and procedures for solving similar conflicts,  it said.    Its indifference with respect to the forceful repression of aspirations of Catalan people for self-rule will be interpreted as a sign of weakness and will deepen the confidence crisis that many Europeans feel toward EU institutions.

"In U.S. presidential first, Trump prays at Jerusalem's Western Wall","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made a historic visit to Jerusalem’s Western Wall on Monday, standing before the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray and saying a few words before inserting a note between the monumental stones. He was accompanied by the Rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinowitz, who said on Israel Radio that he recited two psalms with the U.S. leader. One of them, Psalm 122, speaks of Jerusalem as a “city that is united together”. The ancient stones are in a part of Jerusalem that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It considers all of Jerusalem its indivisible capital, a status that is not recognized internationally. “(Trump) said that he understands the significance of the Western Wall for the Jewish people and that’s why he decided to visit here during his first trip to Israel. He is certain he will come here again, perhaps many times. He was very moved,” Rabinowitz said. “He asked about the size of the Western Wall. We presented the maps, what was in the past, what’s happening now, the excavations, the finds.” The president was joined on the visit by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew who went to the wall shortly after Trump and said prayers. Both he and Trump wore black kippahs, the skull caps worn by religious Jews and by others as a mark of respect.  After a few moments standing silently before the limestone edifice, his right hand resting on the blocks, Trump withdrew and smiled briefly. He did not walk backwards from the wall as religious Jews do as a sign of devotion. It is the first time a sitting U.S. president has visited and prayed at the site. Barack Obama visited in 2008, but it was during the campaign, before he became president. The Wall, the visible portion of which stands more than 60 feet (20 meters) high, was a retaining structure for the second Jewish temple, which stood on an esplanade in the Old City before being destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. The site is known to Jews as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism, and to Muslims as The Noble Sanctuary, where al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and the gold-topped Dome of the Rock, now stand. Access to much of the walled Old City, which is divided into four ‘quarters’ — Muslim, Christian, Armenian and Jewish — was shut down on Monday ahead of Trump’s visit. The area has been the scene of multiple stabbing attacks by Palestinians targeting Jews over the past couple of years.  As Trump and Kushner visited the area of the wall set aside for men, Melania Trump and Ivanka, Kushner’s wife, visited a separate nearby section where women are allowed to pray.  Like her husband, Melania held her right hand up against the towering stones and inserted a note among the cracks, something Jews often do as a means of submitting prayers. Ivanka, who converted to Judaism on marrying her husband, was dressed demurely in black and wore her hair partially covered by a small hat. Video footage showed her crying as she prayed at the wall. Trump’s visit to the site sparked some controversy during the planning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had sought to accompany Trump to the Western Wall. But the State Department said that would not be permitted as officially the Wall is in East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied 50 years ago, and Palestinians seek as the capital of a future state.

Hungary's Jobbik party says fine risks making it insolvent ahead of 2018 vote,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary s main opposition party would be unable to compete at an election next April if state auditors impose a heavy fine in a campaign finance case, a vice chairman for the nationalist Jobbik party told Reuters on Thursday.     The party, which was once on the far right but has moved toward the center in recent years, lags far behind the ruling party Fidesz, according to opinion polls. The case could hurt Jobbik s bid to take the political center ground from the populist and nativist Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has ruled Hungary since 2010. Jobbik should pay a fine of 331 million forints ($1.24 million), equal to a price advantage it received illegally for a billboard campaign. Its annual state subsidy should also be cut by the same sum as a penalty, the auditors said on Wednesday in a preliminary finding. Jobbik denies wrongdoing and has 15 days to respond to the findings. The auditor, called ASZ, will deliver a final ruling in a few weeks and Jobbik would then have to pay the fine even if it challenges the decision in court. The penalties are more than Jobbik s 476 million forint annual state subsidy, which is the party s largest source of funding as it receives only small contributions from donors, Jobbik vice chairman Janos Volner said.  This case has been so absurd that anything is possible,  he said, adding that the inquiry could be a pretext to try to dissolve the party.  They will shake us down for every last penny we have,  he told Reuters by phone. The auditor is independent and non-political, said its spokesman Balint Nemeth. ASZ Chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker while Chief Prosecutor Peter Polt is a former Fidesz member twice appointed to his post by Fidesz-dominated parliaments. On Wednesday, prosecutors also pressed espionage charges against Jobbik European Parliament member Bela Kovacs, who subsequently quit the party. In its ad campaign Jobbik accused Orban and some of his associates of corruption. The party used billboards owned by a tycoon named Lajos Simicska for the campaign. Simicska was once a key ally of Orban who has since become a supporter of Jobbik. In stormy debates with Jobbik party leader Gabor Vona in parliament, Orban has repeatedly said Jobbik has been hijacked by Simicska and accused it of doing his bidding. Jobbik and Simicska deny this. Fidesz restricted the use of privately-owned billboards by political parties in a recent law. Jobbik then bought more than 1,000 billboards outright. The party has declined to detail the sources it used for that deal. ($1 = 266.53 forints) ",worldnews,"December 7, 2017 ",1
"In first visit, Trump urges reform so U.N. can meet full potential","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the United Nations for bloated bureaucracy and mismanagement on his first visit on Monday to U.N. headquarters, calling for  truly bold reforms  so it could be a greater force for world peace. Ahead of his maiden speech to the annual U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump hosted a short event to boost support for changes to the United Nations.  In recent years the United Nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement, while the United Nations on a regular budget has increased by 140 percent and its staff has more than doubled since 2000,  Trump said.  The United Nations must hold every level of management accountable, protect whistleblowers and focus on results rather than on process,  Trump said.   I am confident that if we work together and champion truly bold reforms the United Nations will emerge as a stronger, more effective, more just and greater force for peace and harmony in the world,  Trump said in his first remarks at the U.N. in New York since his inauguration as president in January. In a building where long statements are commonplace, Trump spoke for just four minutes.  Some 128 countries were invited to attend Monday s reform meeting after signing on to a U.S.-drafted 10-point political declaration backing efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  to initiate effective, meaningful reform.  U.N. Security Council veto powers Russia and China did not sign the declaration.  Businessman Trump, who complained during his 2016 election campaign about the United States paying a disproportionate amount of money to the United Nations, made the point again on Monday.  We must ensure that no one and no member state shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden and that s militarily or financially.   The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, providing 22 percent of its $5.4 billion biennial core budget and 28.5 percent of its $7.3 billion peacekeeping budget. The contributions are agreed on by the 193-member General Assembly. Guterres, who also took office in January, told the meeting:  To serve the people we support and the people who support us, we must be nimble and effective, flexible and efficient.  He agreed that U.N bureaucracy was a problem that kept him up at night.      Our shared objective is a 21st century U.N. focused more on people and less on process,  Guterres said.  Value for money while advancing shared values   that is our common goal.  Trump also said that all peacekeeping missions should  have clearly defined goals and metrics for evaluating success.  The United States is reviewing each of the U.N. peacekeeping missions as annual mandates come up for Security Council renewal in a bid to cut costs. The United States is a veto-wielding council member, along with Britain, France, Russia and China. On Sunday night, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.  When asked if the U.N. refugee agency could perform its current missions if the United States cut its voluntary contributions to the budget, according to a pool report Grandi answered:  I would say no.   U.S. aid is vital to what we do to support refugees around the world and to find solutions to their situations,  Grandi said. ",worldnews,"September 18, 2017 ",1

However, Hillary s model does feature an ice chest between the two front seats. (Which might have been used to keep her cottage cheese cold.) The middle chairs are swivel and quick release. Indirect lighting (like mood lighting) throughout the vans.Oh, and there s a bed. The power sofa in the rear of the vehicle converts into a bed.

 Another White Trump Supporter Assaults A Black Man At A Terrifying Rally In The South (VIDEO),"Enough is enough. It s time for Donald Trump to condemn this racist violence or be forced to end his campaign.For the second time in a week, video footage has revealed yet another incident of violent racism at the same Trump rally in North Carolina where an old white redneck sucker-punched a young black protester in the head as he was being escorted out the building by police.78-year-old John McGraw has since been arrested by law enforcement, but now it looks like police are going to have to hunt down and arrest another white racist who assaulted a different black person who, despite not doing anything wrong, was escorted out with other African-American attendees by officers who roughed some of them up for no reason.East Carolina University student Adedayo Adeniyi caught the terrifying experience on his cell phone camera on Wednesday as officers began scuffling with other black people in the stands around him. Hey that s not me, that s them,  Adeniyi says on the video in reference to being told he has to leave even though he wasn t even protesting.  I don t even know them! The cops, who are white, wrestle one protester to the ground and cuff him before leading him off. As Adeniyi is also led off down the aisle, an old white KKK wannabe tells him  Hey, f*ck you, baby, f*ck you!  And then physically assaults him by slapping him, and police didn t seem to care about that at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Afterwards, Adeniyi remarked that the incident made him fear for the future of America because it definitely looks like the country is embracing hate and bigotry. These are presidential candidate rallies,  he told the New York Daily News. I m not at a KKK rally. The fact that I experienced hate at a candidate rally tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump and the people that support him. People will act more hateful and racist in environments that they feel not only encouraged to do it, but accept it as normal. The man at the end of the video is a moment I ll never forget. The hate in his eyes. The words. The hate in those words. The slap. It was disgusting and sad. At that moment I believed that America will stay and continue to be a hateful and bigoted country. Donald Trump s rallies are nothing more than glorified white supremacist rallies that are an embarrassment to this nation and those around the world. The fact that any candidate for political office here in 21st century America actually condones and encourages violence and racism against black people is sickening The fact that the police are serving as Trump s own personal guard and are allowing these acts of violence to occur and in some cases even joining in is just as disgusting. This is not the America any of us should want, but it s the one we ll get if people do not vote in November.Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 11, 2016",0
 High Schools Start Caving To Trump – Will Punish Athletes Who Won’t Stand For National Anthem,"As if Trump calling for a private organization to fire people who refuse to stand for the national anthem wasn t bad enough, it now seems that some high schools have decided to follow his dangerous lead. Parkway High School, in Bossier, Louisiana, will start punishing football players who won t stand for the national anthem. They could face less playing time or getting kicked off the team entirely.Waylon Bates, Parkway s principal, says that they  require students to stand in a respectful manner throughout the National Anthem during any sporting event in which their team is participating. Failure to comply will result in loss of playing time and/or participation as directed by the head coach and principal. Continued failure to comply will result in removal from the team. Parkway High School is committed to creating a positive environment for sporting events that is free of disruption to the athletic contest or game. And it has begun.High schools are now following Trump s order.Will kick off any players who don t stand during the National Anthem. pic.twitter.com/lfNWyW7z5f  Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 28, 2017CBS News says that Bates is trying to keep politics out of his schools athletics. He accomplished the exact opposite with this letter, though. In fact, there s a chance now that this will only spur black athletes and their allies to do exactly what Bates does not want them doing.Evidently, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association allows schools to set their own rules about this kind of thing, so other high schools may or may not follow suit here. But the school doesn t seem to care about anything except forcing students to worship the flag. This is one of the replies to Shaun King s tweet:Called them- said constitution doesn t apply to extracurricular activities. Seriously- they said that.  td_port (@td_port) September 28, 2017Too bad for the school that case law seems to be on the side of any students who wish protest, well, anything by not standing for the national anthem. Almost 75 years ago, in the midst of WWII, the Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 decision stating that public school systems cannot require students to salute the flag in West Virginia State Board of Education et al v. Barnette et al. This decision reversed an earlier SCOTUS decision upholding the ability of schools and districts to do that exact thing.This case is generally seen in the context that requiring students to salute the flag can be a violation of religious principles since the plaintiffs were Jehovah s Witnesses. Their religion prohibits them from saluting symbols. The majority opinion, however, barely even mentions religious freedom. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority in West Virginia Board of Ed v. Barnette, tied this to other freedoms protected in the Bill of Rights, rather than making it about religious expression. He held that  freedoms of speech and of press, of assembly, and of worship may not be infringed [on] slender grounds,  and wrote: Censorship or suppression of expression of opinion is tolerated by our Constitution only when the expression presents a clear and present danger of action of a kind the State is empowered to prevent and publish. It would seem that involuntary affirmation could be commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence. In this case, Jackson believed that silence didn t  create a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to muffle expression,  and said: To sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the individual s right to speak his own mind left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind. Justice Jackson essentially turned the case into one where the government tries to establish its own religion and tries to force its own views onto people; in that case, children. And it could be seen this way in Parkway s case, too, since standing for the national anthem can be considered saluting the flag. The school has delivered an ultimatum to its student athletes: Stand during the national anthem or else.Trump set off a firestorm by calling for NFL owners to fire players who sit or kneel (or stay in the locker room) during the national anthem. Despite the backlash, he s doubled down, and tripled down, and quadrupled down on it, spending a lot of time on Twitter slamming the NFL and completely ignoring the reasons behind the protests (to say nothing of his continued slights to Puerto Rico, which is now in the midst of a humanitarian crisis thanks to back-to-back powerful hurricanes).And now, high schools are starting to weigh in, and it may well be illegal for them to do so. Despite sports being extra-curricular, this is still a school official forcing his students to worship a symbol. And Parkway High School s principal has dragged politics into his athletic program with an ill-advised letter violating the First Amendment rights of students.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2017",0
Panama to send immigration envoys to China as visa limits lifted,"PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama s government will send an immigration and security delegation to China, the country s president said on Tuesday, as part of the lifting of visa restrictions for Chinese visitors.

You are saying no one contacted you? Schultz replied with a shocking statement:  Secretary Johnson is utterly misinformed. That is simply not accurate.

"OREGON: Feds Cover-up Foul Play in Finicum Death, Feds’ Shell Casings ‘Have Gone Missing’","21st Century Wire says As it turns out, we were right about the ambush, and we were right about the cover-up. After all this, the quislings at the The Oregonian are still trying to tart-up this FBI and OSP debacle by calling it a  traffic stop . While forced to now admit that there was foul play on the infallible government s part, mainstream media gatekeepers are still trying to paint the incident as a  traffic stop    which is beyond a joke.Get ready for another government-issued  magic bullet  fairy tale to protect the hired guns.How long before we can call this an assassination? New findings by law enforcement officials suggest that an FBI agent on the scene of the fatal shooting of Bundy-affiliated protester LaVoy Finicum during a Jun. 26 felony stop might have fired two shots that were not reported, and agents on the scene might have disposed of bullet casings to cover them up.According to The Oregonian, investigators believe that the shots were fired approximately at the moment at which LaVoy Finicum was exiting his truck with his hands up, prior to when he appears to reach into his jacket and is shot by two Oregon State Police troopers. The above-embedded slow-motion video shows the moment at which investigators believe the shots were fired.Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson and Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norri, who investigated the incident, concluded that the Oregon State Police officers were justified in shooting Finicum, but also announced that they believe that an FBI agent took two unreported shots and then lied about it. The U.S. Department of Justice has subsequently launched a criminal investigation into the conduct of the FBI agents on the scene.The Oregonian s Les Zaitz wrote,  A state trooper later described to investigators seeing two rifle casings in the area where the [FBI] agents were posted. Detectives tasked with collecting evidence didn t find the casings, police reports indicate. He added,  FBI aerial surveillance video shows that before the detectives could get there, the FBI agents searched the area with flashlights and then huddled, according to law enforcement sources who have seen the video. The group then broke and one agent appeared to bend over twice and pick up something near where the two shots likely were taken. Police reports indicate that detectives showed up to collect evidence around 90 minutes after the moment in the surveillance video in which the FBI agent appeared to pick items up from the ground.All of the FBI agents on the scene that day claimed that they did not take any shots. A state trooper said he had fired three shots while the truck was speeding towards police and two more at Finicum as he was reaching into his jacket after he had exited the vehicle. Police inventory records show that the trooper was missing five rounds after the incident, apparently confirming his story.A fourth bullet hole in the truck came from a different angle of trajectory suggesting that an FBI agent had fired the shot. Investigators believe a second shot, which missed Finicum and did not strike the truck, was also fired by an FBI agent Continue this story at Truth In MediaREAD MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",US_News,"March 17, 2016",0

When the University Economic Development Association recently held its national conference in Roanoke, the keynote speaker highlighted a North Carolina program to encourage partnerships between colleges and companies, as a way help recruit technology companies interested in research and development. The speaker hailed it as a model for other states to follow as they try to build a  knowledge economy.  Then the speaker noted that McCrory had cancelled it. The pro-business audience groaned.On Monday, a data company picked Richmond as the site for a new office, with 730 jobs.

COPS ASK MAYOR TO REMOVE “Black Lives Matter” Banner Hanging At City Hall…His Response Is ASTOUNDING!,"Imagine what it must feel like for these officers who put on their uniforms and go to work, risking their lives in a city whose Mayor has arrogantly displayed an in-your-face banner supporting a cop-hating movement over the front entrance of the City Hall Somerville police officers are asking that the city s mayor remove a banner supporting the  Black Lives Matter  movement from City Hall and replace it with one proclaiming  All Lives Matter. In a Tuesday letter addressed to Mayor Joseph Curtatone, the Somerville Police Employee s Association, the bargaining unit for 90-95 patrol officers, called the city s support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the display of the banner  deeply  troubling. It is as inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our City would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country,  the association wrote.Citing what they saw as  fringe elements  of the movement, officers in the association argued that the activists have at times provoked violence against police around the nation, including the recent shooting in Dallas that killed five officers. The point is that these incidents have incited more than protests; they have incited some within the protest movement to use violence against police officers who had nothing to do with the shootings of black men, and have done so before all of the facts of each case were known,  the letter said.While the association acknowledged that black lives, as well as those of other minorities, matter just as much as white lives, it argued that Somerville s open support for the movement could imply that the department thinks otherwise. At the same time, we strongly object to a public banner sponsored by the City that [implicitly] paints police officers as the killers of innocent citizens of color when there is no evidence whatsoever that the police officers in the City are in anyway using their police power in a discriminatory of unlawful way,  the letter said.Instead, the officers asked that the banner be replaced with one that reads  All Lives Matter,  a move they believe would have the mayor standing in solidarity with the police department. The vast majority of police officers across this country are tasked with shielding, protecting, and assisting elements of the protest movement that loath them, spit on them, intentionally injure them and wish death upon them,  the association wrote.  Nonetheless, it is generally true that officers perform these very tasks with professionalism, honor, integrity, courage, and without hesitation. The letter didn t sway Curtatone, who said he doesn t plan to remove the banner. My unwavering support for our police officers does not and cannot preempt our commitment to addressing systemic racism in our nation,  Curtatone said in a statement to Boston.com.  I ve made very clear to our officers that we should be thankful for and reinforce what we have here in Somerville: a safer community thanks to the highest quality policing by a force dedicated to community policing, de-escalation, proper use of force, and anti-bias awareness.

 WATCH: Violent Trump Fan Shoves Peaceful Protester Down Stairs From Behind Like A Coward,"The violence and hate we witnessed at Trump rallies is now spilling over into the rest of society. Since the billionaire racist misogynist internet troll was elected to lead the free world, there have been literally hundreds of hate crimes (many of which in his name) and his supporters have proved completely unwilling to behave themselves even in their victory.At an anti-Trump protest in Ohio on Monday, we received a reminder of the violent nature of the animals known as Trump voters. As Tim Joseph was delivering his message into a bullhorn at the Ohio Union at OSU in Columbus, one Trump voter voiced his displeasure with the current direction of the country (or whatever bullsh*t the media is saying to explain away these alleged people s behavior today) by shoving the protester down some stairs   from behind like a coward, of course. You idiot,  the disenfranchised white man screeched as he went all WWE on Joseph.One man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask began to beat the living hell out of the attacker, whose identity has not yet been released. Instead of joining in like we saw at Trump rallies throughout the election year, other protesters calmed the man down and the crowd detained him peacefully until police arrived. According to Undergraduate Student Government president Gerard Basalla the attacker, a student, was arrested and placed under indefinite suspension. The assault that occurred   that s what it was   in the Union tonight is completely unacceptable,  Basalla told The Lantern.  Every person on this campus has the right to feel safe and voice their opinion without fearing harm. We can t be having this. We protect First Amendment rights actively, but we do not under any circumstances tolerate intimidation or threats to students, faculty, staff or visitors to our campus,  University President Michael Drake said in an email to students following the attack.Watch the assault below:",News,"November 14, 2016",0
GOP Rep Dave Brat HUMILIATES MSNBC Host Craig Melvin Over Liberal Media Bias…Makes Melvin Wish He Never Interviewed Him [VIDEO],"Republican Congressman David Brat wasn t sitting back and waiting for MSNBC host Craig Melvin to attack him or Republican President Donald Trump. Much to the MSNBC host s surprise, Rep Brat (R-VA) immediately went on offense telling Melvin,  But non one gets to play the innocent here!  Brat went on to explain how the media funds the Democrat Party and yet they expect Americans to believe they are being  objective  when they report the news.  Brat used media donations to Hillary s presidential campaign as an example:  Hillary raised $2 billion dollars in the Hillary foundation from foreign money and CNN and all the biggies never found anything on that. The  Washington Post is great on Watergate, but they missed  Clintongate . It may be because 97% of the donations from mainstream folks (media) go to the Democrat Party. Gee I wonder if that could, ya know, influence the news at all? MSNBC host Craig Melvin attempted to blame the New York Times and Washington Post for the alleged media bias. Melvin then tried to convince his small audience that media bias doesn t exist: Even if that bias did exist   which, I mean, Dave, it doesn t   even if it did   Brat shot back:  If it exists? Now, you got to come clean with me on that one. Brat s best line in the exchange however, came near the end, when Melvin mockingly said,  All of us are in cahoots together .Brat responded:  No, you just have a systematic bias toward liberal outcomes and growing the federal government. It s okay   it s America   I don t know if it s illegal. Watch:",politics,"Jul 18, 2017",0
CNN’s Don Lemon Tries to Downplay Horrific ‘Anti-Trump’ Torture of Mentally Disabled Man,"In case you missed it, CNN anchor Don Lemon went on a drunk, alcohol-fuelled tear this past New Years Eve, drinking tequila shots during CNN s nationally televised show. It was a shocking scene, even by CNN standards. After making a show of himself, the 50 year-old Lemon then got a free pass from CNN executives, and the next day he was back to work on set   as if nothing had happened. Things only got worse from there  On Wednesday, shocking reports surfaced of what appears to be both a politically and racially motivated attack, where four black youths from Chicago kidnapped and tortured a mentally disabled white man (pictured above), in an ordeal which lasted over 24 hours. The perpetrators live-streamed the abuse on Facebook s Live.Later that evening, host Don Lemon assembled a panel of CNN regulars, most of whom  appeared to downplay the political and racial nature of the attack  despite having the video evidence right there, clearly showing the captors  ill intentions.The kidnappers could be heard shouting at their victim, F*** Trump!  and  F*** white people!  as they proceeded to humiliate and torture the mentally disabled man, including taking a knife and  scalping a lock of his hair and drawing blood in the process.Aside from the political and racist overtones, the fact that the victim was a helpless disabled man added another dimension to the cruelty. The fact that this was a vulnerable person who was probably duped into going along with them. It appears it is someone who is mentally disabled, I think makes it even more sickening, said CNN guest Matt Lewis.  But at the end of the day, you just try to wrap your head around evil. That s what this is, it s evil. It s brutality. That s when CNN s Don Lemon stepped in, trying to steer the conversation towards being sympathetic towards the four black assailants, with Lemon stating,  I don t think it s evil. I think these are young people and I think they have bad home training.Lemon s obvious cognitive dissonance is clearly on display here, as the troubled anchor claims he cannot image such criminal behavior, even as four people conspire and broadcast the torture right in front of Lemon s eyes. I say, who is raising these young people? I have no idea who s raising these young people. Because no one I know on Earth who is 17 years old or 70 years old would ever think of treating another person like that. Watch Lemon s shameful gatekeeping episode here: Lemon s racial and political bias was trumped only by CNN s flippant black activist and Democratic Party surrogate, Symone Sanders, who tried selling the idea that this incident wasn t a  hate crime    even though all aspects of an anti-white racist hate were on full display. The Democratic Party worker then infers that Donald Trump is to blame for creating the conditions for the attack, as she callously tries to downplay the event as merely  stupid  on the part of the black kidnappers.One could easily argue based on their commentaries, both Don Lemon and Symone Sanders have a clear bias because of the racial identities of the assailants, and are thus incapable of covering this story with any level of normal objectivity.SEE ALSO: Don Lemon Hits Back at  Fake Information  That He s  Making Excuses  for Torture Gang Democratic Party operative and Black Lives Matter supporter Symone Sanders (Image: CNN)In a separate segment, #BlackLives Matter supporter and CNN panelist Angela Rye, attempted to divert the conversation away from the racist aspects of the crime by attacking The Blaze radio host Glenn Beck who tweeted earlier and blamed the militant activist George Soros-funded militant group Black Lives Matter for the incident.You are right.  Stand up with me and demand justice in Chicago for the beating of a disabled trump supporter by BLM https://t.co/aP79pKnHA1  Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) January 5, 2017It is not yet clear whether any of the four black assailants were members or supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement.Mainstream Media: Institutional Double Standards It goes without saying that had the racial identities been reversed in this case, then it would have sparked national outrage   and certainly organized rioting in dozens of cities across America   as well as any white-on-black crime being blamed on President-Elect Donald Trump.READ MORE CNN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire CNN FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 6, 2017",0

 Hillary Clinton BLASTS Steve King’s Blatant Racism: ‘This Is Literally White Supremacy’,"Hillary Clinton is making sure that the shockingly racist comments made by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) don t slip by her supporters. An email was sent out by the Clinton camp calling out King s bigotry with a subject line that read: This is literally white supremacy. The fundraising appeal, written by Clinton deputy communications director Christina Reynolds, pointed out that this kind of racism has become synonymous with the Trump campaign.King s comments were widely reported as a textbook example of white supremacy, and it wasn t the first time the Party of Trump has had a disturbing connection to white supremacy in recent months.The campaign email continues, reminding readers of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke s endorsement of the bigoted billionaire, as well as Trump s failure to disavow the former Grand Wizard and the KKK in general. The Republican nominee eventually gave a half-hearted condemnation of the infamous hate group and blamed his prior failure to do so on a faulty earpiece.The email also noted Trump s recent anti-Semitic tweet that featured Clinton s picture, on a background of $100 bills, with a Star of David that had the words  Most Corrupt Candidate Ever  written in it. We re taking this seriously. Our country was founded on the idea that we are all created equal, no matter the color of our skin, the faith we practice, or who we love,  Reynolds wrote.  We re going to keep calling Trump out on the deplorable ideas he perpetuates, and we re going to keep fighting to win the White House this November   not just by a few votes, but by an overwhelming majority   to show Trump, white supremacists, and the world in no uncertain terms that here in America, we don t stand for hatred. During King s appearance on MSNBC Monday night, Esquire s Charlie Pierce pointed out that the overwhelming majority of speakers at the Republican National Convention were white, and the Iowa Republican went full on racist. This whole business does get a little tired, Charlie. I would ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people you are talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?  King asked.Co-host Chris Hayes asked,  Than white people? Than Western civilization itself. That s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America, and every place where the footprint Christianity settled the world,  King said.  That s all of Western civilization.

 Maine GOP State Senator Sick Of His Bullsh*t Demands Censure Of Governor Paul LePage,"Republicans in Maine tolerated Governor Paul LePage and his offensive words and actions for a long time, but now they are finally sick of him.LePage has constantly characterized blacks and Hispanics as drug-dealers and  the enemy  but it was a voicemail message he left for Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine that finally caused Republicans to say enough is enough. I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker,  LePage said.  I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I m a racist. I ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You   I need you to, just friggin    I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you. Clearly, LePage lost his sh*t in this message and actually threatened a member of the state legislature.That s a line too far, says Republican state Senator Amy Volk.Volk is so disgusted with LePage that she is seeking a censure, which is a formal resolution expressing severe disapproval that will be on the record. Up until this point, I have refrained from publicly criticizing any of the governor s behavior both out of respect for the office and a desire to preserve a working relationship with him and his staff,  Volk explained.  But this latest and the unwelcome attention it has brought to our state is a bridge too far. My understanding is that it would be by a vote of the legislature that it s sort of an official reprimand entered into the record so you know some sort of displeasure with the governor s behavior,  she added.A censure is a pretty big deal, especially when it s being called for by a member of the governor s own party.Frankly, LePage should have been censured and impeached a long time ago.After all, his outbursts and damaging decisions have embarrassed the state so much that Maine s largest newspaper actually apologized to the nation for him ever being elected to begin with. Dear America: Maine here,  the Portland Press Herald began: Please forgive us   we made a terrible mistake. We managed to elect and re-elect a governor who is unfit for high office. He has a gruff exterior and blunt way of talking that some of us find refreshing, but he has shown again and again that he governs by grudge, and uses his power to beat up on people who cannot fight back. Unfortunately for Maine, unless Republicans grow a spine and impeach their inflammatory governor they will be stuck with him until 2019, giving him plenty of time to humiliate himself and the state even more than he has already.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 29, 2016",0

GLOBALIST COMMIE BILL DE BLASIO Abandons NYC for G20 Protests…Will Phony de Blasio aka Warren Wilhelm Jr. Get in Touch with his German Roots?,"Communist Mayor Bill de Blasio just can t help himself. He had to abandon NYC to go to Hamburg, Germany where his anarchist commie buddies are making a fuss it is what globalist commies do. The problem is that New York City is a mess but globalists like de Blasio don t have time for governing when global policy is in jeopardy The New York Post reported:Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday skipped an NYPD swearing-in ceremony made somber by this week s assassination of a cop   then hours later revealed he was busy preparing to jet off on a surprise trip to join leftist protesters at the G-20 summit in Germany.Hizzoner s overseas jaunt was kept under wraps until just 90 minutes before he took off from Newark Airport. A last-minute announcement said he  will attend several events surrounding the G-20 Summit, including Saturday s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung [Hamburg Shows Attitude] rally. De Blasio will be keynote speaker for the loony anti-capitalists. No word on whether he will throw the ceremonial first brick through a bank window.Meanwhile, the NYPD reels from Miosotis Familia s assassination, the subway system rapidly disintegrates, and NYC in general continues to go to the dogs with trash strewn on streets At least de Blasio, who was born Warren Wilhelm Jr., can get in touch with his German roots.Funny irony WARREN WILHELM, JR OR BILL DE BLASIO? We know that his early political career was Marxist, and not just in an academic sense. He raised money for the Sandinistas, visited Nicaragua to align himself with the tyrants, and worked to undermine the efforts of the Reagan administration. No wonder he was endorsed by George Soros. Curiously, he decided to cover up his radical past: There is no mention of his extremist associations on his website. Quite frankly, Bill de Blasio has a problem with the truth. He was born Warren Wilhelm, Jr. in 1961. When he graduated from New York University in 1983 (where he was heavily involved in leftist causes), he changed his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm. In 2002, he changed his name again, settling on Bill de Blasio. The only reason we know this is because the media put the spotlight on him, forcing the issue.De Blasio s character was impugned again when it was learned that he accepted over $50,000 from a group of slumlords. What made this so outrageous was de Blasio s past denunciations of these same men while serving as public advocate.Just recently, when The New York Times confronted de Blasio about his love for  democratic socialism,  expressed in 1990, he said,  That s not a quote from me; that s someone s notes.  But in fact those were his words. When the Times told him it has the proof, he brazenly said,  It doesn t matter. Please read more on de Blasio s lies here: Newsmax ",politics,"Jul 8, 2017",0
OBAMA’S NEW AND “IMPROVED” FBI Offers HUGE Reward For Anyone Who Can Help Frame White Cop In Black THUG Shooting,"No evidence No worries Obama s got this one. Meanwhile, the Democrat Party s presidential nominee would already be in jail if King Obama wasn t stalling the investigation In case you needed more evidence that Obama s Justice Department is more interested in proving white people are racists than actually fighting crime, here it is: The FBI is offering a huge reward for anyone that can help them frame a white police officer who killed an armed black criminal in a completely justified shooting.Last week, a white Mobile, AL police officer shot and killed Michael Moore during a traffic stop. I know what you are thinking, no, not fat white liberal gasbag Michael Moore, this was black criminal Michael Moore.On June 13th, Officer Harold Hurst with the Mobile PD was on his way to work when he observed a white Lexus make a dangerous left turn into traffic, almost causing an accident. The officer pulled the vehicle over that was being driven by Michael Moore, with two additional passengers. The ID Moore gave was fake and the car was stolen.Officer Hurst called for back up and asked Moore to step out of the car. The officer observed a .40 caliber handgun in Moore s waistband and ordered him to put his hands up. Instead, Moore reached for the gun so Hurst had no choice but to shoot. On the ground, Moore was still trying to get to the gun in his pants and the officer fired another round. Moore was taken to the hospital where he died.Police recovered a gun from Moore s body and one of the passengers in the car confirmed that he had a gun on him at the time of the shooting. This is as cut-and-dry of a justifiable police shooting as you will ever find, but not everyone sees it that way. Moore s family and local black activists insist this was a murder and accuse the police of a cover up.Because any time black people complain about something, no matter how little evidence there is to support their claims, the feds come running. The FBI and the US Attorney s Office have launched an investigation based on one little weird thing.Officer Hurst was on his way to work and had yet to report for duty. As such, he didn t have his body cam on and didn t capture the deadly confrontation. The feds figure this must be evidence that the officer is lying, even though all evidence points to the events unfolding the way Hurst said they did.With no actual evidence, the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward to anyone who may have recorded the shooting on a cell phone according to AL.com. Seriously? There isn t any real crime going on so the feds want to spend a big wad of cash to help them build a case against a police officer who was just doing his duty? This is pathetic.Obama s Justice Department has wasted millions upon millions of dollars trying to prove how racist America is and come up with nothing. With expensive investigations into the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric, Garner, Tamir Rice, and dozens of other black deaths yielding no fruit, the administration seems hell bent on spending as much money as possible to prove Al Sharpton is right about something.Michael Moore was driving a stolen car filled with stolen goods. He had a fake ID and a handgun, which was also stolen. A passenger in his car said Moore had the gun and made a move for it before being shot. Why are the feds even looking at this case?And let s keep in mind that this is the same FBI that didn t see a problem with Omar Mateen, the radical Islamic terrorist who killed 49 people in Orlando.

"Oklahoma lawmaker, found with boy in motel, charged with prostitution","(Reuters) - An Oklahoma Republican state senator who campaigned as a champion of family values was booked on felony prostitution charges on Thursday after police found him in a motel room with a teenage boy and drugs, court documents showed. Ralph Shortey, 35, was charged with three felony counts, including engaging in child prostitution, court documents filed in Cleveland County showed. Shortey, who has served since 2010, has not spoken to media about the incident. According to an arrest affidavit, police found Shortey and a 17-year-old male, who was not named, in a motel room in Moore, south of Oklahoma City, on March 9.  “Officers present observed a strong odor of marijuana coming from the room and inside the room at the time of their contact with the defendant,” the affidavit said, adding the officers also “found an opened box of condoms in the defendant’s backpack.” According to court records, Shortey was booked at a local jail on Thursday afternoon. His bond has been set at $100,000 and local media said he was released about two after he surrendered. Oklahoma politicians from both major parties called on Shortey to resign, including Republican Governor Mary Fallin. “The charges against him do not reflect the character and decorum that we expect of an elected official,” Fallin said in a statement. A guns rights advocate who has taken a hard-line stance against abortion, Shortey was sanctioned by the Republican-dominated state Senate on Wednesday on a 43-0 vote for “disorderly behavior.”  The sanctions imposed penalties such as stripping him of his office space, removing him from committee positions and canceling his reserved parking space.

"Ahead of debate, Trump endorsed by some Bush alumni","NEW YORK (Reuters) - (This story corrects sixth paragraph to say Matt Schlapp was White House political director, not deputy.) Dozens of former appointees of the administration of former President George W. Bush announced their support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday in a bid for party unity ahead of Trump’s first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Bush family and many connected to it remain cool to Trump. Former President George H.W. Bush reportedly plans to vote for Clinton in the Nov. 8 election while his Jeb, a former Trump rival, has said he will not vote for Clinton or Trump. George W. Bush has avoided the presidential race while helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates. But a number of former Bush appointees have decided to endorse Trump, the New York businessman who is in a tight race with Clinton and is to debate her one-one-one at Hofstra University on Monday night in Hempstead, New York. Fifty former Bush appointees were on a list of people described as founding members of a coalition of Bush alumni supportive of Trump. The list was provided by a Republican official close to the Trump campaign. The list included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, former Treasury Secretary John Snow and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson. The list also included former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi and former White House political director Matt Schlapp, who is chairman of the American Conservative Union. Thompson, in a statement, explained his decision to be on the list. “Americans want to trust our leaders again, to know that they are fighting for everyday Americans by creating jobs, growing our economy, defending our nation from terrorism, and respecting the voters enough to be straight-forward and honest with them,” Thompson said. Trump has struggled to rally many in the Republican Party behind him. On Friday, he received the endorsement of former rival Ted Cruz, but many establishment figures remain skeptical about him, such as Ohio Governor John Kasich. ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: U.S. budget plan includes over $13 billion for new submarine - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s next five-year budget proposal seeks over $13 billion in funding for a new submarine to carry nuclear ballistic missiles, plus orders for more Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) fighter jets, according to sources familiar with the plans. The plan also shifts the Navy’s strategy for a new carrier-based unmanned drone to focus more on intelligence-gathering and refueling than combat strike missions, said the sources, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly before the budget’s release.  U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter plans to map out his spending priorities for the $583 billion 2017 defense budget on Tuesday ahead of the official budget release on Feb. 9. The Pentagon’s plan will also underscore the need to fund all three legs of the U.S. strategic deterrent “triad” - a new Air Force bomber, a replacement for the Ohio-class submarines that carry nuclear weapons, and new nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles, said one of the sources. The Navy’s proposed fiscal 2017 budget will fund procurement of materials for the new submarines that take a long time to acquire, with funding for construction of the first full new submarine to follow in fiscal 2021, said one of the sources. Over the next five years, the Navy would spend over $4 billion on research and development of the new submarines, plus over $9 billion in procurement funding, the sources said. General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) has the lead role on the new submarine to replace the current Ohio-class of submarines, together with Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N).  Boeing would receive well over $1 billion in new aircraft orders as it seeks to extend production at the company’s St. Louis facility. The Navy will request funding for two Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets as part of the fiscal 2017 war budget, and 14 in the fiscal 2018 budget, said one of the sources.  Navy officials also will likely add a request for 12 more Boeing Super Hornets to their annual list of “unfunded priorities” for fiscal 2017, said one of the sources. Those moves are aimed at filling a shortfall in the number of strike fighters available on aircraft carriers, given delays in the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet program and longer-than-expected repair times for current Boeing F/A-18 jets. The five-year budget plan calls for Lockheed to sell a total of 161 F-35 fighter jets to the Navy and Marine Corps - 64 C-model jets that take off and land on aircraft carriers and 97 B-model jets, which can take off from shorter runways and land like a helicopter, according to one of the sources.   The proposal also narrows the mission of a new drone to be built by the U.S. Navy, the sources said. To reflect the change, the Navy plans to rename the new drone program the Carrier-Based Air Refueling System, or CBARS, instead of the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program, said one of the sources. The drones would have an initial limited strike capability, but more could be added in coming years, the sources said. Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), which makes the unmanned, unarmed X-47B plane that has been tested on U.S. carriers, and privately held General Atomics spent tens of millions of dollars to prepare for the previous tender. But the program was put on hold in 2014 pending a Pentagon-wide review of intelligence and surveillance programs.   ",politicsNews,"February 1, 2016 ",1
 Trump’s Campaign MAJORLY F*cks Up By Accidentally Emailing Its Anti-Clinton Strategy To A Journalist,"Donald Trump s best efforts to smear Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton have just been ruined and exposed   thanks to the carelessness of his own campaign!On Wednesday, Politico reported that Trump s campaign was planning to roll out several attacks against the former Secretary of State, focusing on her involvement in the Whitewater real estate scandal   which would be an entirely new strategy, considering that all Trump has been doing over the last few days is going after the sexual history and rape allegations of Hillary s husband, former president Bill Clinton.Trump s latest attack blueprint was revealed in an internal Trump campaign email, after campaign adviser Michael Caputo sent a request for a Republican National Committee researcher to work up information on HRC/Whitewater as soon as possible,  stating that  This is for immediate use and for the afternoon talking points process.  In the process of getting the information together, these plans were accidentally sent to an journalist. How does the Trump campaign f*ck up this badly? It s an interesting story. According to Politico: The email was obtained by POLITICO when Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who [Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo] copied on his request to the RNC, accidentally responded instead to Marc Caputo, a POLITICO reporter who is not related to the Republican consultant. And Trump s anti-Clinton strategy wasn t the only thing Hicks let slip through the cracks. She also gave away the fact that RNC staffer Michael Abboud could possibly be jumping ship and joining the Trump campaign. Hicks said, He is still an employee of the RNC and we need to be sensitive to that until he comes over to our team full time. Hilariously, Hicks didn t realize how badly she d screwed up until about 20 minutes later   and all she did to rectify it was send the journalist another email. The email s subject line read,  Wrong email, obviously  and the message contained one pathetic word:  Apologies. Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016",0
LOL! DEMOCRAT CHEERLEADER Cokie Roberts Delivers Devastating News To ABC Comrades: “It is Going to Be Very Hard to Defeat” Roy Moore After Trump’s Endorsement [VIDEO],"Earlier today, President Trump tweeted about the Alabama Senate race where Republican candidate for Senate Judge Roy Moore has been the target of the left ever since he won in the GOP primary race in September, against the less conservative candidate, Luther Strange.The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017Unfortunately for the Democrats, their attempt at destroying the character of Roy Moore, by attempting to paint him as a sexual predator of teenage girls, continues to fall apart. Roy Moore s team is coming out and demanding that the high school yearbook used as evidence by one of Moore s accusers is more looked at by forgery experts after it was discovered that the signature doesn t  match that of Roy Moore s and that two different colors of ink were used for the signature.

Even the high-profile, leftist, media-whore lawyer, Gloria Allred, who represented the accuser with the yearbook, appears to have gone into hiding.  Meanwhile, polls are showing that Roy Moore is ahead by anywhere from 5-15 points and that the left s shameful attempt at stealing the election from the popular conservative candidate in Alabama, is quickly falling apart.Now that President Trump has endorsed Roy Moore, the left appears to be giving up the ship Sunday on ABC s  This Week,  network analyst Cokie Roberts said now that President Donald Trump had supported Alabama GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore, it will be  very hard to defeat  Moore in the December 12 special election.Roberts said,  He doesn t have to go to Alabama.

Clinton Foundation health project still mulling foreign donations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest program of the Clinton Foundation, the family philanthropy of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is still weighing whether to continue accepting foreign donations should Clinton be elected, a spokeswoman said on Friday. It was reported on Thursday that the Clinton Foundation would no longer receive donations from foreigners or corporations if Clinton wins the election in November, an effort to defuse criticism that donors to the globe-straddling charity might inappropriately seek White House favors in return. But representatives of the charities confirmed on Friday that the new guidelines would only apply to a small portion of the foundation’s activities, including its work on climate change and some of its work on economic development. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the foundation’s flagship project credited with reducing the cost of life-saving HIV medicines in the developing world, is yet to decide if it will similarly introduce new limits on donors. “CHAI is a separate legal entity from the Clinton Foundation with its own Board,” Regan Lachapelle, a CHAI spokeswoman, said in an email. “The CHAI Board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps.”  CHAI accounts for nearly 60 percent of the $250 million the foundation spent in 2014, according to the foundation’s most recent annual report posted on its website. CHAI files separate tax returns from the Clinton Foundation, but is included in the foundation’s audited expenses, annual reports and other promotional literature. Similarly, a Canadian offshoot of the foundation, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada), or CGEP, will not be bound by the foundation’s donor limits, but said it will instead become an “independent entity” if Hillary Clinton becomes president. CGEP, which says Canadian law prevents it from disclosing its donors’ names without their permission, was founded by Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, and Canadian businessman Frank Giustra in 2007 to improve work opportunities for people in poor countries.  “If Secretary Clinton wins the election, we plan to spin CGEP into an independent entity to continue this important work,” Giustra said in a statement. “President Clinton and I believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world.” The statement did not specify Bill Clinton’s future role. A spokesman for Clinton’s campaign declined to answer questions about the foundation. The charities have received praise from public health experts for their work alleviating the spread of HIV, and Clinton’s campaign has said any donor expecting political favors in return would be misguided. The family renamed their foundation the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013, although Hillary Clinton stepped down from her board position last year after announcing her presidential bid. Her husband and daughter remain board members. In 2008, Hillary Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family’s charities in order to become President Barack Obama’s secretary of state. She promised that her family’s charities would name all their donors on an annual basis and seek clearance from the U.S. State Department before accepting new donations from foreign government money. Last year, the charities said they did not comply with these promises, blaming “oversights.” On Tuesday, the Boston Globe said in an editorial that the foundation should shut down. “Even if they’ve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort,” the editorial board wrote.

Trump son-in-law Kushner's congressional statement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period. I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. My Role in the Trump for President Campaign Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law’s campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.  Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials. All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaign’s ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not. It is also important to note that a campaign’s success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people. Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons  When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange. With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in  Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions. Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, “What is the name of the Russian ambassador?” Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred. The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the other’s meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as “Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner.” No one else was mentioned. I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote “Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.” I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form. There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname “Guccifer400.” This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump’s tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all traveling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply — which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again. To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.  Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited. On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassador’s name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks — on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President’s National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day. The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his “generals.” He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a “secret back channel.” I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions. Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13. The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts — one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.  To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government. Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it. In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017. That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had “numerous contacts with foreign officials” and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form. It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Israel’s Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before. Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be “update(d), clarif(ied), and explain(ed)” as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting. As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved. It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest. ",politicsNews,"July 24, 2017 ",1
"U.S. Air Force Runs Out Of Bombs To Drop On ISIS…Don’t Worry Though, Barry’s Got This","Bombs a-w oh, never mind Things must be going well in the  war on terror,  as the US Air Force just admitted that it is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS after  B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers.  As ZeeNews reports, Air Force chief of staff General Mark Welsh said as America ramps up its military campaign against the Islamist terror group, the Air Force is now  expending munitions faster than we can replenish them. The US Air Force is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq after its pilots fired off over 20,000 missiles and bombs since the US bombing campaign against the terror group began 15 months ago, its chief has said. As ZeeNews reports, B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers. F-15Es are in the fight because they are able to employ a wide range of weapons and do so with great flexibility. We need the funding in place to ensure we re prepared for the long fight,  Welsh said in the statement. This is a critical need,  he said.The bombing campaign has left the US Air Force with what an Air Force official described as munitions depot stocks  below our desired objective. The Air Force has requested additional funding for Hellfire missiles and is developing plans to ramp up weapons production to replenish its stocks more quickly. But replenishing that stock can take  up to four years from time of expenditure to asset resupply,  the official told CNN. The precision today s wars requires demands the right equipment and capability to achieve desired effects. We need to ensure the necessary funding is in place to not only execute today s wars, but also tomorrow s challenges,  the official said. As The Washington Times concludes, Russia has been bombing ISIS positions sporadically while France and Great Britain are now active in the American-led coalition which could relieve some pressure.Much larger potential adversaries like Russia or China most surely are following this development carefully. If the USAF cannot sustain a trickling battle against a poorly armed, medieval enemy, fighting a superpower military is obviously beyond its capability.Via: Zero Hedge",politics,"Dec 7, 2015",0
Kansas governor tapped as religious ambassador reflects on legacy,"(Reuters) - Kansas Governor Sam Brownback on Thursday shrugged off the political backlash and budget woes stirred by his aggressive tax-cutting policies at home as he looked forward to a new role as the Trump administration’s chief defender of global religious tolerance. The two-term Republican addressed both topics at a news conference in Topeka a day after the White House announced that he would soon be nominated as U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom, a State Department post. Brownback, who previously represented his home state in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, was a sponsor of the 1998 law that created the diplomatic post he now aspires to fill. “International religious freedom is going the wrong way. It’s getting worse around the world, not better,” Brownback told reporters. “It affects all faiths, it affects all religions.” One of Brownback’s most notable forays into the realm of faith as governor came in 2015, when he issued an executive order to protect the religious convictions of clergy as Kansas began to comply with the landmark ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage. His gubernatorial legacy, however, has been largely defined by 2012 legislation he championed to roll back tax rates to help stimulate Kansas’ economy. The deep cuts shrank state coffers and caused Kansas to miss revenue targets, turning the state into a cautionary tale of fiscal mismanagement.  “It’s amazed me, too, that a tax cut done in a Midwestern state in 2012 has been the dominant tax discussion in America the last five years,” Brownback said on Thursday. He mostly defended his tax strategy, though conceded some resulting spending cuts could have been carried out “more artfully.”  More than a dozen conservative allies in the state legislature lost their seats in the November election in what was seen as a political repudiation of Brownback’s fiscal policies. Earlier this year, both chambers of the Republican-controlled legislature voted to raise taxes and overrode Brownback’s attempt to veto that measure. Republican state Representative Melissa Rooker, in a separate interview with Reuters, called Brownback’s tax policy “an unmitigated disaster.” Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, a physician who previously served in the legislature, would succeed Brownback if he resigned to assume the diplomatic post. It was unclear how soon Brownback might move to Washington, D.C. In the meantime, his standing at home is low. Brownback ranks as the second-least popular governor in the United States, with a 66 percent disapproval rating, according to the nonpartisan political research company Morning Consult.

Briton pleads guilty to weapons charge over Trump rally incident,"(Reuters) - A British tourist who caused a security scare at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Las Vegas in June by trying to grab a gun from a police officer pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges of illegal weapon possession and disorderly conduct, court papers showed. Michael Steven Sandford, 20, admitted as part of his plea deal with prosecutors that he had approached a policeman at the event, saying he wanted an autograph from the presidential candidate, then tried to pull the officer’s gun from his holster with both hands, the papers said. Sandford, who had by then overstayed his tourist visa by about 10 months, was immediately arrested and removed from the rally. He also acknowledged having visited a Las Vegas gun range the day before the June 18 incident at the Treasure Island casino-hotel, to take shooting lessons with a rented Glock handgun, firing 20 rounds at a paper target, court papers showed. No mention was made in the plea agreement about whether Sandford intended to harm Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential race.  In the initial June 20 criminal complaint stemming from the incident, prosecutors said Sandford had told a U.S. Secret Service agent he had driven to Las Vegas from California with the aim of shooting Trump. On June 29, Sandford was charged with felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business, but he was not accused of plotting to kill Trump.  At Tuesday’s hearing in federal court in Las Vegas, Sandford pleaded guilty to those two charges, each of which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a statement. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 13. Brenda Weksler, one of Sandford’s federal public defenders, declined to comment. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1
"(VIDEO) WATER WARS: OBAMA’S EPA POWER GRAB TO REGULATE PUDDLES, PONDS, AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT’S WET","The EPA had already started expanding powers over private property via the Clean Water Act when last year we covered a case of the EPA fining a family a crazy amount per day:EPA TARGETS COUPLE S PRIVATE POND:NOW THE EPA HAS EXPANDED ITS POWERS TO JUST ABOUT EVERY POSSIBLE THING THAT HAS TO DO WITH WATER:The EPA has released its Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule critics say would allow the agency to regulate waterways previously not under federal jurisdiction, including puddles, ditches and isolated wetlands.Republicans, farmers and industrial groups have called the rule an EPA  power grab  because it extends the agency s powers to new heights. Environmentalists and the Obama administration, however, argue the WOTUS rule is necessary for protecting water quality.No matter how you spin it, the EPA s WOTUS rule does expand the agency s authority, and creates new avenues for environmental groups to sue projects they want to stop from moving forward. The administration s decree to unilaterally expand federal authority is a raw and tyrannical power grab that will crush jobs,  House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. Despite their assurances, it appears that EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have failed to keep their promises to Congress and the American people,  echoed Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe.  In fact, instead of fixing the overreach in the proposed rule, remarkably, EPA has made it even broader. Farmers and industry groups worry the new WOTUS rule will expand EPA reach over isolated wetlands, ponds and ditches that have a  significant nexus  to navigable waters   a vague standard employed by the EPA to regulate bodies of water.read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"May 27, 2015",0
DRAIN THE SWAMP! Republicans NOT Running for Re-election in 2018,"One thing President Trump has been able to do while in office is expose the politicians who are not true conservatives and who aren t supporting his policies. Politicians like Jeff Flake fought Trump on immigration and border security every step of the way. The voters agreed with Trump so Flake was heading for defeat in Arizona by a large margin. Instead of announcing his decision to not seek reelection quietly, Flake chose to grandstand and bash President Trump in what can only be described as a sour grapes hate-fest.

Bob Corker, R-Tenn.After tangling with President Trump, including questioning his  stability  and  competence,  Corker put an end to speculation and announced he would not be running again in 2018. Corker and Trump have since engaged in multiple scraps on Twitter, Corker calling it  a shame the White House has become an adult day care center  and Trump saying Corker  couldn t get elected dog catcher. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa.Dent, a centrist Republican, announced in September that he d decided against running for re-election after consulting with family and advisers. Pennsylvania state Rep. Justin Simmons had announced he would challenge Dent in the primary. Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.Sen.

"From Wall Street to Wisconsin, brokers cheer Trump's order","NEW YORK (Reuters) - With a swipe of his pen, U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday started killing off a retirement advice rule that wealth managers from Wall Street to Wisconsin have spent the last six years lobbying against. A landmark policy from the Obama era, the so-called fiduciary rule requires brokers and financial advisers to act in the best interest of retirement savers. This restricts their ability to earn commissions and to sell some higher-fee products. Wall Street has argued it would harm consumers because it would raise compliance costs and therefore fees, and force them to get rid of Main Street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans. Trump’s executive order asks the Labor Department to review whether the rule needs to be changed or dumped. Both supporters and opponents are girding to argue their case. But the industry has the edge, with Trump officials stating they were planning on rolling back regulation generally and criticizing the fiduciary rule in particular. The Chamber of Commerce, one of a number of trade groups which have filed lawsuits to kill the rule, cheered Trump’s order. “We look forward to swift action from the Department of Labor in putting this delay into effect and reevaluating matters of policy and law,” the Chamber said in a statement. Shares of banks with large wealth management divisions jumped on Friday with Bank of America (BAC.N) up 2.5 percent, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) 5.5 percent stronger and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) over 2 percent higher. Insurers, whose sales of annuity products were at risk from the rule, also rose, with shares of Prudential (PRU.N) up 1.9 percent and Metlife (MET.N) 1 percent stronger. “Everyone will be pleased that DOL’s rush to get it done before the administration change is set back,” said Judi Carsrud, director of government relations for the National Association of Insurance Financial Advisors (NAIFA), which has been fighting the rule for years. NAIFA plans to pursue a “very straightforward” fix such as a “legislative approach” that directs retirement account advisers to act in clients’ best interest – a standard that Carsrud believes the group’s members already meet. The Obama administration had said conflicted advice costs American families $17 billion a year but the industry has said that figure was inflated. No-one disputes the high cost that firms would have to pay to comply with the new rule, an amount the Labor Department estimates at as much as $31 billion over the next decade. Banks have already started changing things with Bank of America saying this week it would more clearly disclose the fees it charges clients of its Merrill Lynch wealth management business. Bank of America Corp had already started cutting back on “transactional” accounts that charge clients a commission for every trade, rather than a flat fee based on assets. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has decided to keep such accounts but is making changes that will allow advisers to work within the rule’s confines by creating new contracts, re-training advisors and updating supervisory software. Swiss bank UBS UBSN.VX welcomed Trump’s order and said it supported the creation of a fiduciary rule under the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could apply to all advisers not just retirement advisers. Wells Fargo said it would continue to work with regulators to ensure higher standards of care for investment clients. Other banks either declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment. Implementing changes was particularly tough for small-time financial advisers. Along with two colleagues, Juli McNeely, who runs McNeely Financial Services in Spencer, Wisconsin has spent between 45 and 60 hours each week since December preparing for the rule. Their work has focused largely on figuring out which clients from their rural community should now pay a flat fee for financial advice, instead of commissions, and creating new templates for paperwork. “Now we have a little breathing room to make sure we do this right and not quickly to meet a deadline,” said McNeely, who voted for Trump, in part because of his pro-business stance. One person who has yet to comment on the retirement rule review is the person who will be at the center of it — Trump’s choice to head the Labor Department, Andy Puzder. Puzder, chief executive of fastfood group CKE Restaurants, has been a vocal opponent of what he has called “overregulation” during the Obama administration. The 401(k) plans he offers his own employees are less generous than some rivals, suggesting a more industry-friendly approach. While the Labor Secretary cannot unilaterally repeal a rule, his agency can rewrite and change a rule substantially or scrap it. William Galvin, the top securities regulator in Massachusetts, described Trump’s order as “reckless”. “My office will continue to protect small investors when those in Washington cave to big business.” Not all proponents of the rule were as pessimistic. “There’s no question that in the minds of industry lobbyist, delay is just a step toward repeal,” said Barbara Roper, investor protection director for the Consumer Federation of America (CFA). “If the Department of Labor follows an honest process and considers the impact on retirement savers, we have a winning argument.” ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2017 ",1

Finland wants EU to give up daylight saving time,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish government should actively push the European Union to abolish its directive on daylight saving time, a parliament committee said on Thursday. The parliamentary transport and communications committee gave its recommendation to the government after more than 70,000 Finns signed a citizens petition asking the state to give up the practice. Under daylight saving time clocks move forward by one hour during summer months so that daylight lasts longer into evening. Most of North America and Europe follows the custom, while the majority of countries elsewhere do not. The committee said that after hearing several experts, it concluded that people do not adapt smoothly to the changes. It added that turning the clocks caused short-term sleeping disorders, reduced performance at work and could also lead to serious health problems.  The primary objective should be to abolish the clock movements on uniform basis throughout the European Union,  the committee said in a statement. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"France's Macron seeks renewal of Africa ties, but old problems persist","PARIS (Reuters) - Barely six months into office, President Emmanuel Macron is already preparing for his third visit to sub-Saharan Africa. Yet while the energetic young leader is eager to reshape France s relationship with the continent, old problems die hard. His Nov. 28-30 trip to Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ivory Coast is aimed at boosting cooperation on education, the digital economy and the environment. The visit will be capped by an EU-Africa summit in Abidjan, when migration will top the agenda.   Africa is not just the continent of migration and crises. It s a continent of the future,  the 39-year-old president told French ambassadors in August. But even then, French forces were being sucked deeper into a years-long battle to quell Islamist militancy in Mali. Last month, a raid by French special forces in the Malian desert illustrated how deep that quagmire is becoming. French troops stormed an Islamist training camp, killing 15 suspected militants. French officials said the operation was based on intelligence the camp housed Malians who had joined the Islamists. Mali said government soldiers held hostage by the Ansar al-Dine group were among the dead. As recriminations flew, a defense official spoke of  a real trust problem . Laurent Bigot, a former under-secretary in the French foreign ministry, was blunt:  Mali is a disaster,  he said.  We re repeating mistakes made in Iraq and Afghanistan.  That assessment underlines just how much work Macron faces if he is to strengthen security and migration policy without getting bogged down in costly military ventures. More than 7,000 French troops are already deployed across Africa.  Macron will make his first stop in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso, where he will set out his vision for Franco-African relations in his favored style - a speech. Language and tone are critical. French presidents usually make early visits to Africa, but some have misjudged. Nicolas Sarkozy declared  the tragedy of Africa is that the African has not fully entered into history . The comment has haunted him. A presidency official said Macron would emphasize education and investing in youth across the continent, themes he has touched on in his first six months in power.  In Ghana, a former British colony where France has ramped up investment, including in oil, telecoms and technology, Macron is to promote the digital economy and a broadening of French education initiatives.  In Ivory Coast, environment will be the main topic, before EU and African leaders meet to discuss security and migration, with both Macron and Germany s Angela Merkel keen to limit the flow of migrants to Europe by introducing tighter checks and controls on African soil, not in Europe.   Macron s proposals to bolster African growth and create jobs echo Germany s call for a  Marshall Plan for Africa . He also promises to raise France s aid budget from 0.38 percent of national income to 0.55 percent by 2022.    After French colonialism ended in the 1950s and 60s, France wielded a tight grip over its former dominions, using military might to install leaders in return for French companies securing lucrative contracts   a policy dubbed  Francafrique . But French diplomats say the days of France throwing its weight around for commercial favors are over.  Macron, born months after Djibouti became the last French colony to gain independence, has shown little inclination to revive the old networks that linked French businessmen and intelligence agents with African politicians.   We have a president who has never known the colonies and never had those close links to the region s leaders. He has more freedom to say what he thinks,  said one diplomat. Macron has created an African Presidential Council to help shape his thoughts. Its 11 members are mostly young, dual-national entrepreneurs with backgrounds in art, media, finance and ecology. It reports directly to the president, irking some in diplomatic circles.  France s shift away from Francafrique has eroded the privileges once enjoyed by companies such as Total, Orange and Areva, just as globalization has opened the field to China and India. French business group Medef is lobbying Macron for a greater role for the private sector in his vision for Africa, although some acknowledge French companies face huge competition and can still suffer an image problem.  Africa is a fast growing continent, business opportunities are not a problem,  said Patrice Fonlladosa, president of Veolia Africa & Middle East and head of Medef s Africa committee.  The problem is being chosen as the partner of choice.   ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1
" Trump Indicates WH Previously Lied, Second Secret Putin Meeting Was ‘More Than Small Talk’","Whenever the White House puts out a statement regarding Donald Trump, you can be sure of one thing: it s just a matter of time until Trump himself contradicts that statement. Over and over, Trump has thrown his spokespeople under the bus as he publicly says the opposite of what his surrogates have told the public. And he just did it again.According to the White House, Trump s second meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin was merely  a brief conversation at the end of a dinner, nothing more than a perfectly innocent exchange of  pleasantries and small talk.  True to form, Trump blew this cover to smithereens shortly after the statement was made and revealed that the private meeting, which officials say lasted  more than an hour,  was actually a discussion about policy.Here is what Trump had to say to the New York Times about his second meeting with Putin:She [Melania Trump] was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, and that s the way it is. So the meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about   things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.We talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting. Because, you know, he ended that years ago. And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don [Jr., Mr. Trump s son] had in that meeting.And here s the problem with what he said. The whole topic of Russian adoption is far from just being casual small talk. Putin got mad when President Obama implemented the Magnitsky Act in 2012, which was meant to punish Russia for their blatant human rights violations. In retaliation, Putin banned the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens.So, by stating that he and Putin discussed Russian adoptions, Trump just inadvertently admitted that he discussed official policy in a private meeting with a foreign adversary. Whoops. This puts the U.S. government at a significant disadvantage because we have no record of what transpired conversationally between the president and Putin, former NATO commander James Stavridis explained.Yet again, Trump has chosen Russia and Putin over the American people.

John Kerry commits more U.S. military aid for ex-Soviet Georgia,"TBILISI (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry told ex-Soviet Georgia that the United States would help it bolster its army as he reassured a close U.S. ally days before a NATO summit expected to focus on the threat a resurgent Russia poses. Kerry, on his first visit to Georgia as Secretary of State, made the commitment ahead of a NATO summit in Warsaw on Friday at which members of the Western military alliance plan to announce action to deter possible Russian military aggression. Georgia and former Soviet states such as Moldova and Ukraine have become increasingly concerned by Russia’s intentions after the Kremlin annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and launched air strikes in Syria last year. Moscow says such fears are unfounded and based on what it calls anti-Russian hysteria.   In a memorandum of understanding signed on Wednesday by Kerry and Georgian Prime Minister Georgy Kvirikashvili, the United States promised to bolster Georgia’s ability to defend itself against potential threats. That meant greater military and security cooperation, enhanced information sharing, and help building up defense capacity, such as improving combat readiness and supporting defense procurement, the document said. Until now, U.S. security support has focused on training Georgian troops for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. “The United States stands firm in its commitment to Georgia’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders,” Kerry told reporters. Georgia, which is crisscrossed by strategically important oil and gas pipelines, fought and lost a short war with Russia in 2008. Moscow then recognized two breakaway pro-Kremlin Georgian regions - South Ossetia and Abkhazia - as independent countries, though most other countries have not. “Russia’s occupation and militarization of parts of Georgia’s territory are unacceptable,” said Kerry. “We continue to call on Russia to fulfill its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement, including a withdrawal of its forces to pre-conflict positions.” Moscow for its part has accused the West, notably Washington, of stirring anti-Russian feelings in former Soviet states it deems part of its own sphere of influence. Kerry visits Ukraine next, on Thursday, before heading to Warsaw to join U.S. President Barack Obama for the NATO summit. In Ukraine, Kerry’s third visit there since Russia annexed Crimea, he will focus on the implementation of the Minsk peace accords and the country’s reform agenda. It will be Kerry’s first chance to meet new Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
OH BOY! TARGET CUSTOMERS RESPOND TO THE NEW GENDER NEUTRAL TOY LABELING,"Oh boy! Target customers are hot under the collar on this pc move to give toys gender neutrality. Angry customers are ditching Target and have been very vocal about their displeasure on social media: @thehill so now being PC is more important than helping customers. No more Target shopping for me Target is bringing Americans one step closer to a gender-neutral society. The department store chain announced what it called  something exciting  Friday. After some customers complained about certain toys  being designated as appropriate for girls, it is doing away with signs denoting gender classifications. Over the past year, guests have raised important questions about a handful of signs in our stores that offer product suggestions based on gender,  according to Target s online publication,  A Bullseye View. Toys no longer will be labeled according to sex and displayed on either pink or blue shelving. Gender-neutral signage also will appear in the children s bedding section. The only place gender labels will remain is in the children s clothing department.The gender-labeling brouhaha began last June when Target customer and Ohio mother Abi Bechtel snapped a photo of Target signage indicating  Building Sets  and  Girls  Building Sets  and tweeted it to the chain along with a stern message. It stood out to me as a good example of the way our culture tends to view boys and men as the default, normal option, and girls and women as the specialized option,  Bechtel told CNN.Maybe that particular sign was a bit ridiculous, but it certainly didn t require eliminating all gender classifications to correct it.Oddly, Target said that  we use signs and displays specially designed to help guests get through the store efficiently,  and  signs that sort by brand, age or gender help them get ideas and find things faster. So, the answer is to remove signs that help customers  get through the store efficiently ?Read more: BIZ PAC REVIEW",left-news,"Aug 13, 2015",0
 Bombshell Report Shows The Russian Meeting Was No ‘Nothing Burger’,"While the defense of three members of Trump s camp meeting with Russians last year has taken more turns than a roller coaster, one defense has been constant: It s a  nothing burger.  While Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort did meet with Russians to get dirt on Hillary Clinton, the argument is that it doesn t matter because they didn t actually receive any dirt.Of course that argument gave us a whole host of botched bank robber and  To Catch a Predator  analogies, basically saying that if you intend to commit a crime and you act upon it, you have committed a crime, whether or not you get the goods.No matter how flawed that defense is, though, it turns out it s not even true. Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort were given some dirt on Hillary Clinton. From near the bottom of an AP article:Veselnitskaya brought with her a plastic folder with printed-out documents that detailed what she believed was the flow of illicit funds to the Democrats, Akhmetshin said. Veselnitskaya presented the contents of the documents to the Trump associates and suggested that making the information public could help the campaign, he said. This could be a good issue to expose how the DNC is accepting bad money,  Akhmetshin recalled her saying.Trump Jr. asked the attorney if she had sufficient evidence to back up her claims, including whether she could demonstrate the flow of the money. But Veselnitskaya said the Trump campaign would need to research it more. After that, Trump Jr. lost interest, according to Akhmetshin. They couldn t wait for the meeting to end,  he said.Akhmetshin said he does not know if Veselnitskaya s documents were provided by the Russian government. He said he thinks she left the materials with the Trump associates. It was unclear if she handed the documents to anyone in the room or simply left them behind, he said.So if the members of the Trump campaign didn t take the information, it was only because they would have had to do some of their own legwork. Not only is this administration the most crooked in American history, they are the most lazy. They didn t just want some opposition research from the Russians. They appeared to want the Russians to do all their work for them.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"July 14, 2017",0
"In Cuba visit, Colorado governor sees government desire to work with Trump","HAVANA (Reuters) - The governor of Colorado said on Sunday he believes the Cuban government wants to further improve relations with the United States under President Donald Trump, as he wrapped up a three-day visit to the Communist-run island nation. “They seemed eager for the chance to build a relationship with President Trump and have it be a constructive one,” Governor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said of his meeting with Cuba’s point person for U.S. relations, Josefina Vidal. He said in an interview that Vidal, director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, and other foreign ministry officials “were cautiously optimistic.” “They realize they have to wait and that the new administration has a lot of things going on. They understand things could change in some ways, but I didn’t sense there was any fear or some sort of depression,” the governor said. Hickenlooper, who traveled with a cultural and business delegation, was the highest-ranking elected U.S. official to meet with Vidal since Trump assumed office last month. Trump has said he wanted a better deal than that brokered by his predecessor, Barack Obama. On Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said a “full review” of America’s foreign policy toward Cuba was underway. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro stunned the world in December 2014 when they announced the two governments would restore diplomatic ties after more than 50 years of Cold War hostilities and work to normalize relations. The Colorado governor said the purpose of his trip was to view post-Fidel Castro Cuba and invite the country to his state’s Biennial of the Americas, which brings together the cultures, businesses and ideas of North and South America. Hickenlooper said the Cubans had enthusiastically accepted the invitation to attend the event in September. Hickenlooper said he did not doubt many innocent people were hurt during the early years of the Revolution, but most of those involved had passed away. “The younger people seem eager to build a relationship with the United States,” he said. The governor, a former entrepreneur and restaurant owner, spent a day meeting with small business owners and said he had visited five private eateries. “I was surprised. One has this vision of everyone being downtrodden, and there was so much optimism and positive energy,” he said. “Some of the business people did say if you see President Trump please tell him to let us keep the beginnings of this new inspiration,” he said.

Collins told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast it would be “very difficult for me to support the bill if I do not prevail on those two issues” but she was encouraged by her discussions with leadership. Collins said she has proposed an amendment to the tax bill that would retain the deduction for property taxes up to $10,000, as the House bill does. The Senate bill repeals the Affordable Care Act fine on people who do not purchase health insurance, which will lead to higher insurance premiums. Collins has asked lawmakers to include in a separate bill provisions that would help insurers cover expensive patients, and that would continue Obamacare subsidy payments for low income people for two years. The Republican from Maine also said one of her amendments to the tax bill is a refundable tax credit for adult dependent care that would be paid for by closing a loophole on carried interest.  Collins said she believed the corporate tax rate does not need to be cut as low as 20 percent, as President Donald Trump has favored. She said 21 or 22 percent would be “fine with me.” She said she expected a Senate floor vote during the tax bill debate on making individual tax cuts permanent, or to make corporate tax cuts expire at same time as individual cuts.

Distrustful U.S. allies force spy agency to back down in encryption fight,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An international group of cryptography experts has forced the U.S. National Security Agency to back down over two data encryption techniques it wanted set as global industry standards, reflecting deep mistrust among close U.S. allies. In interviews and emails seen by Reuters, academic and industry experts from countries including Germany, Japan and Israel worried that the U.S. electronic spy agency was pushing the new techniques not because they were good encryption tools, but because it knew how to break them.  The NSA has now agreed to drop all but the most powerful versions of the techniques - those least likely to be vulnerable to hacks - to address the concerns. The dispute, which has played out in a series of closed-door meetings around the world over the past three years and has not been previously reported, turns on whether the International Organization of Standards should approve two NSA data encryption techniques, known as Simon and Speck. The U.S. delegation to the ISO on encryption issues includes a handful of NSA officials, though it is controlled by an American standards body, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  The presence of the NSA officials and former NSA contractor Edward Snowden s revelations about the agency s penetration of global electronic systems have made a number of delegates suspicious of the U.S. delegation s motives, according to interviews with a dozen current and former delegates. A number of them voiced their distrust in emails to one another, seen by Reuters, and in written comments that are part of the process. The suspicions stem largely from internal NSA documents disclosed by Snowden that showed the agency had previously plotted to manipulate standards and promote technology it could penetrate. Budget documents, for example, sought funding to  insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems.   More than a dozen of the experts involved in the approval process for Simon and Speck feared that if the NSA was able to crack the encryption techniques, it would gain a  back door  into coded transmissions, according to the interviews and emails and other documents seen by Reuters.    I don t trust the designers,  Israeli delegate Orr Dunkelman, a computer science professor at the University of Haifa, told Reuters, citing Snowden s papers.  There are quite a lot of people in NSA who think their job is to subvert standards. My job is to secure standards.  The NSA, which does not confirm the authenticity of any Snowden documents, told Reuters it developed the new encryption tools to protect sensitive U.S. government computer and communications equipment without requiring a lot of computer processing power. NSA officials said via email they want commercial technology companies that sell to the government to use the techniques, and that is more likely to happen when they have been designated a global standard by the ISO.  Asked if it could beat Simon and Speck encryption, the NSA officials said:  We firmly believe they are secure.  ISO, an independent organization with delegations from 162 member countries, sets standards on everything from medical packaging to road signs. Its working groups can spend years picking best practices and technologies for an ISO seal of approval. As the fight over Simon and Speck played out, the ISO twice voted to delay the multi-stage process of approving them. In oral and written comments, opponents cited the lack of peer-reviewed publication by the creators, the absence of industry adoption or a clear need for the new ciphers, and the partial success of academics in showing their weaknesses. Some ISO delegates said much of their skepticism stemmed from the 2000s, when NSA experts invented a component for encryption called Dual Elliptic Curve and got it adopted as a global standard.  ISO s approval of Dual EC was considered a success inside the agency, according to documents passed by Snowden to the founders of the online news site The Intercept, which made them available to Reuters. The documents said the agency guided the Dual EC proposal through four ISO meetings until it emerged as a standard.  In 2007, mathematicians in private industry showed that Dual EC could hide a back door, theoretically enabling the NSA to eavesdrop without detection. After the Snowden leaks, Reuters reported that the U.S. government had paid security company RSA $10 million to include Dual EC in a software development kit that was used by programmers around the world.  The ISO and other standards groups subsequently retracted their endorsements of Dual EC. The NSA declined to discuss it. In the case of Simon and Speck, the NSA says the formulas are needed for defensive purposes. But the official who led the now-disbanded NSA division responsible for defense, known as the Information Assurance Directorate, said his unit did not develop Simon and Speck.  There are probably some legitimate questions around whether these ciphers are actually needed,  said Curtis Dukes, who retired earlier this year. Similar encryption techniques already exist, and the need for new ones is theoretical, he said. ANSI, the body that leads the U.S. delegation to the ISO, said it had simply forwarded the NSA proposals to the organization and had not endorsed them. When the United States first introduced Simon and Speck as a proposed ISO standard in 2014, experts from several countries expressed reservations, said Shin ichiro Matsuo, the head of the Japanese encryption delegation. Some delegates had no objection. Chris Mitchell, a member of the British delegation, said he supported Simon and Speck, noting that  no one has succeeded in breaking the algorithms.  He acknowledged, though, that after the Dual EC revelations,  trust, particularly for U.S. government participants in standardization, is now non-existent.  At a meeting in Jaipur, India, in October 2015, NSA officials in the American delegation pushed back against critics, questioning their expertise, witnesses said.  A German delegate at the Jaipur talks, Christian Wenzel-Benner, subsequently sent an email seeking support from dozens of cryptographers. He wrote that all seven German experts were  very concerned  about Simon and Speck.   How can we expect companies and citizens to use security algorithms from ISO standards if those algorithms come from a source that has compromised security-related ISO standards just a few years ago?  Wenzel-Benner asked. Such views helped delay Simon and Speck again, delegates said. But the Americans kept pushing, and at an October 2016 meeting in Abu Dhabi, a majority of individual delegates approved the techniques, moving them up to a country-by-country vote. There, the proposal fell one vote short of the required two-thirds majority.  Finally, at a March 2017 meeting in Hamilton, New Zealand, the Americans distributed a 22-page explanation of its design  and a summary of attempts to break them - the sort of paper that formed part of what delegates had been seeking since 2014. Simon and Speck, aimed respectively at hardware and software, each have robust versions and more  lightweight  variants. The Americans agreed in Hamilton to compromise and dropped the most lightweight versions.  Opponents saw that as a major if partial victory, and it paved the way to compromise. In another nation-by-nation poll last month, the sturdiest versions advanced to the final stage of the approval process, again by a single vote, with Japan, Germany and Israel remaining opposed. A final vote takes place in February. ",worldnews,"September 21, 2017 ",1
Comey says Trump fired him to undermine FBI Russia investigation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of firing him to try to undermine the agency’s investigation of possible collusion by Trump’s campaign with Russia’s alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9.  During more than two hours of testimony, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed Trump had directed him in February to drop an FBI probe into the Republican president’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now investigating the Russia allegations, “to sort that out.” “I don’t think it’s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning,” Comey testified. Sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question, Comey gave short, deliberative answers. He painted a picture of an overbearing president he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the FBI probe of Flynn. Trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offense potentially could lead to Trump being impeached, although his fellow Republicans who control Congress have shown little appetite for such a move. In a speech to supporters across town, Trump vowed to fight on. “We’re under siege ... but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever,” he said. Comey did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and Russia, an issue that has dogged the president’s first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. Nevertheless, the Russia matter likely will continue to overshadow Trump’s presidency, especially as the FBI probe has ensnared not only Flynn but Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation. Comey’s testimony drew renewed attention to Sessions and his relationship with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak.  After Trump fired Comey, the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal. Trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on May 11 he fired Comey because of the Russia matter. Asked why he thought Trump fired him, Comey said he did not know for sure. He added: “Again, I take the president’s words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that.” Comey said repeatedly there were details he could not discuss in a public session, making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators. Comey said Trump’s administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying the FBI was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. “Those were lies, plain and simple,” Comey said. His accusations could further mire Trump’s administration in legal difficulties. Mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by Russia to help Trump win the election. “The Russian investigation is going to go on and it’s not going to stop and the president should have known that,” committee member Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told MSNBC. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comey’s testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there was no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of Russian interference in last year’s election. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty, as Comey said. NBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was expected to meet with staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in mid-June.   Comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with Trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with Trump to people outside the Justice Department and asked a friend to share its contents with a journalist. Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman confirmed to Reuters he was the friend to whom Comey was referring. Kasowitz said that “we will leave it to the appropriate authorities” to determine whether Comey’s leak “should be investigated.” Legal experts questioned Kasowitz’s contention that Trump’s private encounters with Comey should be considered privileged communications.     Comey said he did not know if there were tapes of his conversations with Trump, but that if so, they should be released. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Comey said. Republicans on the committee questioned Comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly, as a witness making accusations against a sitting Republican president might expect. Comey testified he kept notes after meeting with Trump because “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.” From Capitol Hill to San Francisco’s Castro district, Comey’s appearance attracted television “watch parties” beckoning politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the “Super Bowl of Washington.” U.S. stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to Comey’s testimony, viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of Trump’s presidency.  Comey said Trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall Russia investigation, just the part of if that related to Flynn, whom the president fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Kislyak. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked Comey whether he perceived the president’s request to let the Flynn matter go as an order given Trump’s position as president, the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation.     “Yes,” Comey replied.     Laura Donohue, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said if Trump fired Comey to change the course of the Russia investigation, that would constitute obstruction of justice. Both the conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts, she said. “He wanted to scuttle the investigation - it is hard to see it any other way,” she said.  Regarding Sessions, Comey said he did not discuss Trump’s pressure to drop the probe into Flynn with the attorney general because the FBI leadership team believed Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russia probe. “We were also aware of facts that I can’t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic,” Comey said, without giving more details. The Justice Department later issued a statement saying that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe only because he had been part of Trump’s campaign. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he did not believe Trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash, adding: “I’ll just say it, if being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty.” ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2017 ",1
White House to make decision on 9/11 report by June: Bob Graham,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will likely make a decision by June on whether it will release some classified material withheld from the public 9/11 Commission Report, a former U.S. senator who co-chaired the congressional inquiry into the attacks said on Sunday. The withheld section of the official report on the 2001 attacks is central to a dispute over whether Americans should be able to sue the Saudi Arabian government for damages. The Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence is reviewing the material to see whether it can be declassified.     Former Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, has been pressing for the release of the information and said that it may shed light on the financial backers for 19 hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept 11, 2001. Graham told NBC’s Meet the Press that he believed that some of the withheld classified material could soon be released. “The president’s staff at least has said that they will make a decision by June, and I hope that decision is to honor the American people and make it available,” Graham said. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said last week that he also supported releasing the material. “The release of these pages will not end debate over the issue, but it will quiet rumors over their contents,” Representative Adam Schiff said in a statement. “As is often the case, the reality is less damaging than the uncertainty.” ",politicsNews,"April 24, 2016 ",1

DEMOCRATS THREATEN KIDS EDUCATION: CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION DEMANDS RAISES AS Chicago Public Schools Run Out Of Money In One Week,"It s painful to watch the stupidity and irresponsibility of the Democrats who run the city of Chicago along with Chicago Teachers Union president, Karen Lewis, one of the most hard-core radical, leftist s in the business. It s T-minus one week for Chicago Public Schools.As schools let out for the summer, CPS administrators are scrambling to come up with a more than $600 million teacher pension payment due at the end of the month and the district has zero reserves, according to media reports.The problem is further compounded by a more than $1 billion school budget shortfall for the next fiscal year and an angry teachers union hell bent on securing another raise the district can t afford. With no plan, no money and no where to turn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel seems to be focused solely on a state bailout as the solution. Springfield has to step up and help in this case, not only as it relates to just the pension payment, (but also) the educational opportunities of our children,  Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune.  Because a payment will then begin to impact   the classroom. And CTU could soon partner with its mortal enemies at City Hall to lobby state lawmakers for more money. Right now, the district needs us,  CTU VP Jesse Sharkey told the news site.  The politics of (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel going to Springfield are a lot different than the politics of Rahm Emanuel and (CTU President) Karen Lewis going to Springfield. The dire financial situation comes amid a federal investigation into a $20 million no-bid contract to a previous employer of former CPS superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned this month. It feels like a complete mess,  Better Government Association senior editor Sarah Karp told ABC 7.Karp doesn t think recently elected Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who ran on a platform of fiscal restraint and criticized union influence in Illinois, is receptive to calls for a bailout. He previously suggested that bankruptcy may be the best way out for CPS, ABC 7 reports. Now, Chicago Public Schools does not have somebody in the State House that is a Democrat or is seemingly sympathetic at all to what s going on here,  Karp said.Meanwhile, school ended for the summer on Friday, and principals around the city are left scratching their heads in planning for next school year. Normally you do your planning in the summer and you can t do too much planning without the actual dollar amount,  Coles Language Academy principal Jeff Dase told ABC 7.Dase said many Chicago principals are concerned that the budget turmoil, and looming possibility of layoffs and program cuts, could convince many of the city s teachers to seek jobs elsewhere.The Tribune reports the city council could authorize CPS to increase taxes on residents, or secure some sort of bailout, or negotiate concessions with CTU, but not even all three combined could put the budget back on track. And then there s another $228 million payment coming due for costs related to interest rate swaps on the district s debt.    (E)ven if CPS wins concession from the City Council, state lawmakers and CTU, the district won t be able to close its annual $1 billion budget gap, according to a May 22 report by Ernst & Young, which spent four weeks meeting with school finance officials and analyzing budget documents,  the Tribune reports. The report shows that even with a capital improvement tax, a separate, even-larger property tax increase, additional state aid, increased state funding of teacher pensions, concessions from the CTU and $150 million with of budget cuts, CPS would still face an annual $350 million shortfall. Next June s teacher pension payment is set to balloon to $700 million. Via: EAG News",politics,"Jun 24, 2015",0

N. DAKOTA LEGISLATOR Proposes Bill To PROTECT MOTORISTS If They Hit Pipeline Protesters Intentionally Blocking Roads,"Protesters who take to the streets in North Dakota might want to look both ways for changes in the rules of the road.A bill sponsored by state Rep. Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, would protect drivers from legal consequences if they inadvertently hit, injure or kill pedestrians who are obstructing traffic.The legislation is a direct response to the massive protests around the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, Kempenich said. The ongoing protests have shut down a nearby highway for months and stalled construction of a pipeline that would carry crude from the North Dakota oil patch. If you stay off the roadway, this would never be an issue,  Kempenich said.  Those motorists are going about the lawful, legal exercise of their right to drive down the road.   Those people didn t ask to be in this. The legislation has drawn withering criticism from Standing Rock supporters, who worry that it could be open season for protesters on North Dakota roads.Kempenich said he wants to shift the blame for a crash from drivers to the people who choose to protest in traffic. The legislation, he said, would not protect someone who deliberately tries to run down a protester, and it would not let drivers off the hook if they hit a jaywalker or a child chasing a ball into the street. This bill puts the onus on somebody who s made a conscious decision to put themselves in harm s way,  he said.  You can protest all you want, but you can t protest up on a roadway. It s dangerous for everybody.    Star TribuneHighways shouldn t be used as staging areas for protests, Kempenich said.  They re intentionally putting themselves in danger,  he said, adding that accidents could result.Blocking roads or highways has also been a tactic adopted on occasion by protesters in other movements, such as Black Lives Matter.A spokeswoman for the pipeline protests said she is concerned the bill, if passed, would give careless drivers a free pass to kill or maim people who are exercising their free speech rights. It is basically giving permission for vehicular homicide, and that is wrong,  said Joye Braun, an organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network.  Nobody has the right to take the life of another person. The network is an activist group that opposes the pipeline, which would carry Bakken crude oil across the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Protesters say the pipeline s path crosses sacred land and could endanger the tribe s source of drinking water.Braun said she once was struck by a woman who objected to her video-recording a protest outside a fast-food restaurant in Mandan, and she worries the bill would embolden people to harm pipeline protesters. I believe there is a small element who may use this as an excuse to attack people,  Braun said.The proposal has attracted some national attention.

Guatemala prosecutors raid Millicom offices in graft probe,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s attorney general and a United Nations-backed commission against impunity in Guatemala searched the offices of Millicom International Cellular s local unit on Thursday as part of a corruption investigation. The raid comes four months after Ivan Velasquez, head of the commission, known as CICIG, said in July it would investigate Tigo, the Guatemalan affiliate of emerging markets mobile and media group Millicom, over alleged illegal campaign financing and corruption.     Tigo declined to comment on the raid. Guatemalan police arrested 17 people in July on suspicion of involvement in a corruption racket allegedly directed by the country s former communications minister, Alejandro Sinibaldi, who has been on the run since June 2016. During the probe, investigators found evidence of payments from Telecomunicaciones de Guatemala S.A. (Telgua), a subsidiary of billionaire Carlos Slim s America Movil, in Sinibaldi s account. CICIG said that the payments were made to secure the company favorable treatment in a dispute with Tigo.  America Movil said at the time it would audit the unit. In October 2015, Millicom said it had reported to U.S. and Swedish authorities  potential improper payments  on behalf of its joint-venture in Guatemala, sending its shares down.  It was not immediately clear if this was related to the current investigation.      ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Religious liberty bill passes Georgia state legislature," (In March 16 item, corrects timing of legislative session in final paragraph) By Rich McKay ATLANTA (Reuters) - A religious freedom bill described by opponents as being discriminatory against same-sex couples passed the Georgia state legislature on Wednesday night in an 11th-hour vote ahead of the session’s close.  The legislation, dubbed the Religious Liberty Bill, still has to be signed by Georgia’s Republican Governor Nathan Deal to become law. Deal has made clear that he will not sign a bill that allows discrimination, but his office did not immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday night. Similar bills in states like Indiana and Arkansas sparked storms of criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat from the provisions. The Georgia bill, reworked several times by lawmakers amid criticism that earlier versions went too far, declares that no pastor can be forced to perform a same-sex wedding.  The bill also grants faith-based organizations – churches, religious schools or associations - the right to reject holding events for people or groups of whom they object. Faith-based groups also could not be forced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the organization’s. Opponents say the bill could be used to deny services and discriminate against same-sex couples. “The decision by the legislature today was to make an egregious and discriminatory bill even worse,” the Human Rights Campaign, which represents the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, said in a statement.  “It’s appalling that anti-equality extremists in the legislature are trying to ignore the will of the people of Georgia,” it said. Mike Griffin, a lobbyist and spokesman for the Georgia Baptist Convention, applauded the bill’s passage. He said that while the bill did not give them everything they wanted, he added: “We feel we’ve advanced our protection of our First Amendment Right to religious freedom.” “Our rights of religious liberty don’t end inside the four walls of a church,” he said. In a late added amendment, the proposed law says that it cannot allow discrimination already prohibited by federal law, which opponents said could nullify some of its provisions. More than 300 large corporations and small businesses, including Delta Airlines and Coca Cola, have signed a pledge decrying the Georgia legislation and urging the state lawmakers to drop it. The state legislature is set to wrap up its current legislative session next week. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Elite Nazi-allied Order From Hungary Claims Trump Adviser Sebastian Gorka Is Sworn Member,"Lili Bayer and Larry Cohler-Esses HaaretzSebastian Gorka, President Trump s top counter-terrorism adviser, is a formal member of a Hungarian far-right group that is listed by the U.S. State Department as having been  under the direction of the Nazi Government of Germany  during World War II, leaders of the organization have told the Forward.The elite order, known as the Vit zi Rend, was established as a loyalist group by Admiral Miklos Horthy, who ruled Hungary as a staunch nationalist from 1920 to October 1944. A self-confessed anti-Semite, Horthy imposed restrictive Jewish laws prior to World War II and collaborated with Hitler during the conflict. His cooperation with the Nazi regime included the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews into Nazi hands. STRANGE CHARACTER: People are now questioning why Trump hired bizarre Hungarian author as his  terrorism  expert.Gorka s membership in the organization   if these Vit zi Rend leaders are correct, and if Gorka did not disclose this when he entered the United States as an immigrant   could have implications for his immigration status. The State Department s Foreign Affairs Manual specifies that members of the Vit zi Rend  are presumed to be inadmissible  to the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act.Gorka   who Vit zi Rend leaders say took a lifelong oath of loyalty to their group   did not respond to multiple emails sent to his work and personal accounts, asking whether he is a member of the Vit zi Rend and, if so, whether he disclosed this on his immigration application and on his application to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2012.

I want a President who refuses to allow the media to control the narrative. I want a President who has raised a family he can be proud of and for that matter, that America can be proud of. For all those reasons and many, many more, I am excited that Donald J. Trump will be the Republican candidate for President.As a side note, I m also looking to clean up my friends list. If any of my Facebook  friends  feel it is more important to thump their chests and demand that they will never vote for Trump (or in other words, that they will support Hillary) kindly hit the un-friend button at the top of my page. I m on the side of America, and I m choosing to support a man who loves his country so much that he s wiling to walk away from everything he s worked so hard to build in order to save us. Trump didn t ask to walk through barricades to get away from hateful liberals in CA who would like harm him. He didn t ask for Soros funded freaks to follow him wherever he goes, threatening violence against him and his supporters. He could be sitting in Trump Towers working on multimillion dollar deals, but God chose a different path for him and he accepted the challenge. I am grateful to him for the sacrifices he and his family will make, and I will pray that God keeps him safe, healthy and strong. Most of all, I will pray that he brings jobs back to the millions of unemployed Americans who have given up hope on ever finding a job. I will pray that he follows through on his promise to help our veterans to get the best health care America has to offer. And finally, I will pray that he rebuilds our military and gives our soldiers the ability to fight to win, and to keep the greatest nation in the world safe and prosperous for generations to come.There is no time to waste with petty bickering. While I understand there will be a lot of hard feelings amongst Ted, Carly and Marco supporters, it s time to come together now for the good of our country.Bill Clinton is walking around in a state of mostly confusion, while Hillary is traveling with a full-time physician. In addition to being the MOST crooked candidate to ever run for President, she is not well. She will likely chose the old Socialist Bernie Sanders as her running mate to shore up the young voters she cannot persuade to support her campaign. Sadly, Hillary knows she can t win without the  I just want free-shit  vote. Together, they will destroy more businesses, as they increase EPA regulations to fight a phony climate change war. They ll decrease spending for our military in order to reallocate funds to more social programs and programs designed to tighten the screws on our law enforcement, making it nearly impossible for them to do their jobs. The conditions at our VA hospitals will worsen, as our tax dollars will be used to pay for free college for young people who have no clue what it means to selflessly serve their country. There will be a push for gun control like we ve never seen before in America, and we will witness some of the most radical Supreme Court picks who will wholly support their progressive agenda. Meanwhile, people who have the ability to stop another four years of Obama will be proudly tweeting #NeverTrump, as though we should admire them for their courage to stand up for their  principles! I have three young daughters. I won t give up this fight until I know we have a President who takes the threat of Sharia Law in America seriously. For anyone who thinks that can t happen, London is on the verge of electing a radical Muslim as their next Mayor, as I write this rant.When November rolls around, I ll be supporting a candidate who isn t worried about hurting the feelings of a radical Muslim with a suicide vest in his suitcase, as he travels (at the expense of the American taxpayer) to his new taxpayer funded home in my neighborhood. It s time to wise up and start coming together like the Democrats do after each and every primary. It s time to try something new it s called  winning.  #NeverHillary!  Patty100% FED UP! momAndrew Breitbart gave this speech only weeks before he died. His words have never been more relevant than they are today: There are two paths one is America and the other one is  Occupy  (Black Lives Matter).

SECOND TWIN FALLS SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE…Mohammed Hussein I.

Ex-U.S. spy chiefs urge Congress to renew internet surveillance law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. intelligence officials who worked for both Republican and Democratic presidents urged Congress on Monday to renew an internet surveillance program they said has stopped militant plots and helped policymakers steer through international crises. The program, authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, allows U.S. spy agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States. It will expire on Dec. 31 if Congress does not act. “We have personally reported to our Presidents - Republican and Democratic - and to the Congress details of plots disrupted based on information from Section 702,” the former intelligence chiefs said in letters to congressional leaders that were seen by Reuters. “We strongly urge the Congress to reauthorize the program and continue allowing the intelligence community to protect our country,” they wrote. The letter’s signatories include former directors of U.S. national intelligence, the CIA and the National Security Agency; and a former attorney general. Rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, oppose the law in its current form because it sometimes  incidentally collects communications of Americans. Those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal and national security investigations. The Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to privately vote on Tuesday on a bill to reauthorize Section 702 that privacy advocates say will largely lack their reform priorities. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democratic member of the panel, sent a letter on Monday urging committee leaders to allow a vote to take place publicly, saying the bill “will have enormous impact on the security, liberty, and constitutional rights of the American people” and should be debated in the open. A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives earlier this month introduced legislation intended to install new privacy protections for 702 surveillance, including a partial restriction on the FBI’s ability to access American data that would require agents obtain a warrant when seeking evidence of a crime. The former spy chiefs’ letter was sent to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House, and heads of the Senate and House Intelligence and Judiciary committees. Implementation of the Section 702 program, they wrote, has received positive reviews from the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. The letter was signed by former directors of national intelligence Dennis Blair, James Clapper and Mike McConnell; former attorney general Michael Mukasey; former CIA director John Brennan; former NSA chief Keith Alexander; and Michael Hayden, who led both the CIA and the NSA.

Brazil struggles to help state dependent on Venezuela for power,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is looking at all options, including large batteries, to help northern Roraima state with power supplies after a series of blackouts in recent months largely related to its dependency on cash-strapped neighbor Venezuela. Roraima is the only Brazilian state not connected to the national power grid. Its capital, Boa Vista, and most other cities in the state are supplied by power produced in Venezuela and transmitted through a line that was opened in 2001. Documents produced by a Brazilian government committee monitoring the power sector show the state suffered 17 large-scale power outages since August. The documents, seen by Reuters, said only one instance was not related to Venezuela. The situation underscores how Venezuela s economic collapse is affecting its neighbors. Roraima is already dealing with a flood of Venezuelan migrants looking for food and work.  The economic situation in Venezuela is precarious, and it affects power line maintenance,   F bio Lopes Alves, electricity secretary at Brazil s Energy Ministry, told Reuters.  It is extremely worrying, we are studying how to assist them,  he said. The Energy and the Information ministries in Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment. A source at state-controlled Venezuelan power firm Corpoelec acknowledged that lack of maintenance is hurting Venezuela s power transmission system.   The dams are full of water, the rainy season has filled the dams, but the lack of maintenance means that we still have power outages,  the source said, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the issue. Brazil s government is evaluating quickly awarding licenses for companies to build local power generation projects of various types, including both renewable and non-renewable energy. It is also studying the possibility of buying large-scale batteries. Asked why Roraima is still not connected to the national power grid, Alves said a project for a new line awarded in 2011 to a consortium formed by Centrais El tricas Brasileiras SA and Alupar Investimento SA was never built because of difficulties obtaining environmental permits.  Roraima is home to some of the largest indigenous lands in Brazil, such as the Raposa Serra do Sol reserve with 1.74 million hectares (4.2 million acres), an area similar to that of Kuwait. The proposed line would cut through one of them. The government plans to award a new license early next year for the construction of a power line to connect Roraima to the grid, Alves said.

Ex-ally of Malaysian PM Najib held in graft probe: source,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A senior Malaysian opposition leader was detained by anti-corruption authorities on Thursday, a source said, as part of a nationwide campaign against graft launched by Prime Minister Najib Razak. Hundreds of people including many high-profile figures have been arrested this year by the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC), at a time when a multi-billion dollar scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) hangs over Najib. Shafie Apdal, a former close ally of Najib, was detained at the MACC office in the state of Sabah in connection with a RM1.5 billion ($355 million) embezzlement probe, according to a source in the anti-graft agency. The investigation covers alleged corruption involving projects doled out by the federal government through the Rural and Regional Development Ministry between 2009 and 2015, when it was run by Shafie.  He will be brought before a magistrate for a remand hearing tomorrow,  said the source, who was not authorized to issue statements on behalf of the MACC. Shafie could not be contacted. Darell Leiking, Deputy President of his Parti Warisan Sabah party, described the arrest as political persecution.  We shall ensure that we shall fight for justice for all those who this (Najib) regime intends to suppress and intimidate,  Darell told Reuters. Prior to Shafie s arrest, the anti-graft agency detained two of his brothers and several senior Warisan leaders. Shafie, a former vice-president of Najib s ruling United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), quit the party after he was suspended for questioning the prime minister over his handling of the 1MDB scandal. He later founded Warisan to run for office in his home state. Over the past two years, Najib has grappled with the 1MDB scandal which has been the subject of investigations in at least six countries for money-laundering and misappropriation of funds. Malaysia s attorney-general closed the 1MDB probe in January 2016, and cleared Najib of any wrongdoing.  ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
" GOP Ex-Gov Of New Jersey Attacks Christie For Endorsing Trump, Will Vote Blue If He Wins","Donald Trump is causing mass chaos within the Republican Party as infighting over endorsements reaches a fever pitch.On Friday, New Jersey governor and former Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie threw his support behind Donald Trump, in spite of repeatedly attacking him while on the campaign trail.Gov. Christie s endorsement brought New Jersey s former governor Christie Whitman out of the woodwork on Sunday. She blasted Christie s endorsement of Trump, saying if he wins the party s nomination, she will be voting for Hillary Clinton.The former governor told nj.com, I am ashamed that Christie would endorse anyone who has employed the kind of hate mongering and racism that Trump has. I would have thought being from a diverse state would have given him more awareness and compassion. Christie claimed that if Trump wins the nomination, we ll see a lot of republicans back Hillary Clinton instead.Jeb Bush staffers also blasted Christie for endorsing Trump.David Kochel, Bush s chief strategist during his now-defunct campaign for the GOP nomination, blasted Christie on Twitter.Bush s former campaign spokesman posted a whole series of Tweets blasting Christie as well:Image credit: Tim Miller via TwitterTo be fair, Chris Christie isn t the only Republican to endorse Trump.Trump s also earned the endorsement of former Arizona Governor and all around crazy person, Jan Brewer. Not surprisingly, the former governor is most excited about Trump s delusional promise to build a wall along the Mexican border, which he says will keep out all the scary brown people.Maine s governor, Paul LePage, who is currently tied with Michigan Governor Rick Snyder for worst governor in the United States, has also endorsed Donald Trump. Like Christie, LePage publicly denounced Trump last week.Trump also has been endorsed by at least two Republican members of Congress. Rep. Chris Collins of New York praised Trump s understanding of  American exceptionalism,  while Rep. Duncan Hunter of California threw his support behind the candidate only after realizing that absolutely no-one was going to vote for Mike Huckabee.Trump also has earned endorsements from former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, and the Daily Stormer, the country s most popular Neo-Nazi website.Meanwhile, South Carolina republican Lindsey Graham blasted everyone who supports Trump, saying that he s run out of adjectives to describe  how bad I think Donald Trump is for the party and for the country. As for Trump, during an interview with Good Morning America, he said that endorsements are  a waste of time. To prove it, as Christie attempted to take the stage at a Trump rally yesterday, apparently to announce his not-so-coveted endorsement, audio captured the GOP frontrunner telling Christie to get back on the plane and go home.Watch the hilarious video here.Image credit: Michael Vadon, via wikemedia commons",News,"February 28, 2016",0
House votes to protect 'dark money' political donors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to protect the identities of wealthy individuals and others who make anonymous, or “dark money,” donations to politically active nonprofit groups. The measure, which drew lobbying support from billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, was approved in a 240-180 vote along party lines. It would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names and addresses of donors who contribute $5,000 or more to 501(c) organizations, a name that refers to the tax code section that covers them. The action sent the bill on to the Senate. Although the measure would apply to all 501(c) tax-exempt groups, such as universities, hospitals and charities, politically active nonprofits are the intended beneficiaries. Republicans said the legislation would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from targeting conservative groups following 2013 revelations that Tea Party organizations were subjected to extra scrutiny. Political spending by nonprofit groups including the Koch- aligned Americans for Prosperity has grown dramatically since 2010, when the Supreme Court opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups in its landmark Citizens United ruling.  The White House on Monday said it opposed the bill, the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, claiming it would constrain the IRS from enforcing tax laws and reduce transparency among private foundations. Democrats argued that the legislation could make it easier for foreign entities to finance political campaigns inside the United States.  Charity regulators have also warned that the loss of donor information would make it harder to protect the public against charity fraud. The change would reduce available information on a range of organizations, IRS data shows. Republicans said the bill is necessary to protect donors from potential leaks that could subject them to harassment. Donor identities are not supposed to be released to the public, hence the term “dark money.”  But leaks have occurred, including the 2012 release of donors to the conservative National Organization for Marriage that resulted in a settlement requiring the IRS to pay the organization $50,000. Supporters of the legislation also pointed to signs that the IRS may seek to end the disclosure requirement on its own.     Nonprofit groups could spend more than $500 million on this year’s presidential and congressional elections, up from $10 million in 2008, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. House Republicans are also pushing to censure and impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for allegedly failing to cooperate with a probe of the IRS scandal.   ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Obama turns focus to U.S. Congress as he campaigns for Clinton,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Sunday campaigned in the battleground state of Nevada for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate he wants to succeed him in the White House - but he spent most of his time talking about the state’s Senate race. Democrats badly want to get back control of the Republican-controlled Senate in the Nov. 8 election, and are sending Obama, Michelle Obama and Joe Biden to states where close races could tip the balance. In Nevada, Obama reserved most of his firepower for mocking three-term Republican U.S. Representative Joe Heck, who had supported his party’s presidential candidate until earlier this month when Donald Trump’s campaign went into crisis mode by the release of a video in which he lewdly bragged about groping and kissing women. “I understand Joe Heck now wishes he never said those things about Donald Trump, but they’re on tape, they’re on the record,” Obama said, using Heck’s earlier praise of Trump against him. It’s not just the Senate. Obama wants to capitalize on his high approval rating to help elect more Democrats to the House of Representatives, and has also endorsed about 150 candidates in state legislative races. At an intimate fundraising dinner in La Jolla, California, on Sunday evening, where tickets started at $10,000, Obama urged about 60 guests to help elect Democratic congressional candidate Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel who is challenging Republican incumbent Darrell Issa. “As far as I can tell, (Darrell) Issa’s primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere,” Obama said. Issa, the former head of the House Oversight Committee, led a series of headline-grabbing investigations into Obama’s administration - but has featured a photo of Obama signing legislation on a campaign brochure. “Now that is the definition of chutzpah!” Obama said. Last week, Obama excoriated Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida - who has a narrow lead over Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy, a congressman - for failing to repudiate Trump. In the final two weeks leading up to Nov. 8, Clinton said she planned to work hard to support congressional and state races. “We’re going to be emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats down the ballot,” Clinton told reporters traveling with her on Saturday. In Las Vegas, Obama was introduced by the Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto, a two-term Nevada attorney general, who would be the first Latina elected to the U.S Senate if she wins. “We can’t elect Hillary and then saddle her with a Congress that is do-nothing, won’t even try to do something,” Obama said. The Nevada Senate seat is the only Senate race this year that Republicans could flip to their control. The seat has long been held by Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, who is retiring. Cortez Masto currently has a slim 2.3 percentage point lead in an average of polls tracked by RealClearPolitics over Heck. Obama won Nevada in 2008 and 2012. Polls show Clinton with a 4.2 percentage point lead at 45.4 percent support to Trump’s 41.3 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average. ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1
WOW! FBI SUED Over Andrew Breitbart Records Request…What Are They Withholding?,"The speech he gave to a sold out crowd on Saturday is epic. We often listen to it to get fired up about bringing down the commies currently trying to destroy America. It s truly epic! THE SPEECH THAT BREITBART IS BEST KNOWN FOR IS HIS CPAC SPEECH:The complaint, filed Friday in federal court in California, says that Leopold filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI for  all records related to Andrew Breitbart  on Aug. 7, 2012, a few months after Breitbart died at age 43.According to the suit, the FBI responded to the request on Sept. 4, but said that the bureau only searched it  main file records,  claiming that no records were located.The complaint says that Leopold appealed the FBI s response but was denied by the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Information in 2013. In its appeal decision, OIP claimed that the FBI is not required to perform cross-reference searches unless the requester provides  information sufficient to enable the FBI to determine with certainty that any cross-references it locates are identifiable to the subject of [the] request,  including, for example, the dates and locations of contacts between the subject of the request and the FBI, the subject s social security number, or other such information,  the suit reads.However, BuzzFeed and Leopold contend in the complaint,  Nothing in the FOIA statute requires a requester to provide this information before a cross-reference search must be conducted. As FBI and OIP are certainly aware, Andrew Breitbart was a well-known public figure and is easily identifiable by the FBI in conducting a cross-reference search,  the suit reads.  As the FBI and OIP are also aware, cross-reference searches frequently turn up records not located in main file searches. Via: THE WRAP",Government News,"Apr 8, 2017",0
 Bill O’Reilly Plays Stump The Trump On Foreign Policy And Makes Him Look Like A Fool (VIDEO),"Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday night, only to be embarrassingly stumped by Bill O Reilly.O Reilly wanted to know if Trump plans on taking military action against Iran if he becomes president, and Trump totally demonstrated his lack of foreign policy knowledge by dodging the question and ranting about things he really doesn t understand. If you re elected president are you going to take military action against Iran?  O Reilly asked.  Are you going to do something to that country? Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia,  Trump replied with what seems to be a reference to Iranians attacking the Saudi Arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the Saudis recently committed on New Year s Day in which 47 were killed, including a Shiite cleric.  I would want to protect Saudi Arabia,  Trump claimed.  But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically Trump suggested that he might attack Iran if Saudi Arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get America involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the Middle East.O Reilly continued to press Trump for an answer, calling him out for dodging the question.Trump then went on a tirade against the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a disastrous deal that Iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that Iran will have a nuclear weapon  very soon. Clearly, Trump is not aware of the fact that Iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians, which is definitive proof that the Iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.The Iran nuclear deal stands as one of President Obama s greatest achievements, and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is nothing more than ISIS posing as a legitimate nation. They use Sharia law and behead so many people every year that ISIS leaders must be envious. The only reason our government has failed to call the Saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world.This is why it is not only important for the United States to reject military action in the Middle East, we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on Saudi Arabia for our energy needs. Frankly, the United States government should grow a pair and strongly condemn Saudi Arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization.The bottom line, however, is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief. He not only wants to send American troops to die needlessly in Iran, he wants to make Saudi Arabia pay for it. Basically, Trump would turn America into a puppet for the Saudis. But more likely, he would damage relations with both nations and put America squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into World War III.America does not need more war. We need peace. And as O Reilly pointed out, voters have the right to know what Trump plans to do, even if Trump thinks they have no right to know at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 6, 2016",0
"Trump's first year in office marked by controversy, protests","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump took office, his presidency started generating controversy.  Photographs showing that the crowd at Trump’s swearing-in was smaller than at Barack Obama’s first presidential inauguration in 2009 caused the first ruckus in his administration - but not the last.  Trump’s first year in office was colored by an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Russian government to affect the election outcome, insults and threats of war with North Korea, and an effort to pass business-friendly legislation.  From the start, the White House took a combative approach, accusing the media of framing photographs of the inauguration in a way that appeared to understate the crowd size.  Press Secretary Sean Spicer argued that the images were not what they seemed and that crowds of historic size watched Trump take the oath of office. Protests would become a hallmark of Trump’s first year. On Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women jammed the streets of Washington to demonstrate opposition to Trump. A week after taking office, the Republican president signed an executive order to prevent citizens of seven predominately-Muslim countries from traveling to the United States. Known by critics as the “Muslim ban,” protesters quickly demonstrated at airports in opposition.   Trump would ignite protests again in August, when he was asked to respond to white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, Virginia, including one who drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman. The president argued there were bad people “on both sides.”  Following his remarks, business leaders resigned from Trump’s business councils and the panels were disbanded.     A defining feature of Trump’s first year in office was the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the election. Trump ignited a political firestorm in May when he fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into possible collusion by the Trump 2016 presidential campaign with Russia to influence the election outcome. Russia has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied any collusion. Soon afterward, the Justice Department named former FBI chief Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation. Paul Manafort, who had briefly served as Trump’s campaign manager, and his business associate Rick Gates were indicted by Mueller’s team in October, accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. A month later, Michael Flynn, who briefly served under Trump as U.S. national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations last December with Russia’s then-ambassador in Washington just weeks before Trump took office. Trump has also found himself embroiled in a war of words with North Korea over its missile program, exchanging insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. At home, Trump has struggled to enact sweeping changes he promised on the campaign trail.  He threatened to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but business lobbyists persuaded him to renegotiate it. Trump signed an executive order setting up talks on the trilateral trade deal, which has hit roadblocks with Mexico and Canada.     Trump’s team also failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare despite Republican control of the White House and Congress. It was not until December that Trump made headway on major legislative change as both chambers of Congress passed a sweeping tax overhaul.  The bill must be reconciled with a different version approved by the House of Representatives, but the Senate bill is expected to remain largely intact.

Yemeni al Qaeda leader calls for attacks in support of Myanmar's Rohingya,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior leader of al Qaeda s Yemeni branch has called for attacks on Myanmar authorities in support of minority Rohingya Muslims, the SITE monitoring center said on Saturday as thousands fled what they say is a government assault on their villages. Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya pose one of the biggest challenges facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of failing to support the Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution. In a video message released by al Qaeda s al-Malahem media foundation, Khaled Batarfi called on Muslims in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Malaysia to support their Rohingya Muslim brethren against the  enemies of Allah.  Batarfi, who was freed from a Yemeni prison in 2015 when Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) seized the port city of Mukalla, also urged al Qaeda s Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) branch to carry out attacks.  So spare no effort in waging jihad against them and repulsing their attacks, and beware of letting down our brothers in Burma (Myanmar),  Batarfi said, according to the U.S.-based monitoring center. About 58,600 Rohingya have fled into neighboring Bangladesh from Myanmar, according to U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. Myanmar officials accuse the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) of burning homes. The group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week that prompted clashes and a large army counter-offensive. But Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is conducting a campaign of arson and killings to drive them out. The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Bangladesh, where more than 400,000 Rohingya live since they began fleeing Myanmar in the 1990s, is also growing increasingly hostile to the minority.

 Women’s March Now One Of The Most Peaceful Demonstrations In American History,"The numbers are in, and over 3 million men and women of all backgrounds took to the streets all across the nation to protest Donald Trump and his incoming disastrous presidency.In 670 cities throughout the north, south, east and west   in some of the most conservative enclaves like Lubbock, Texas  protestors partook in peaceful demonstrations, and their decorum shined bright.Not one person was arrested, and not incident of violence surfaced.In Washington D.C, over 500,000 men and women gathered on the National Mall, and not one violent act sullied the day, and no arrests made for any reason.In Los Angeles, 750,000 convened (even though police only prepared for 80,000), and like Washington, not one arrest was made and not one incident of violence occurred.In New York City, 400,000 people convened, and not one was arrested.Not only were the demonstrations peaceful and orderly, police officers were deeply involved with the community, expressing solidarity with men and women:DC cops posted across from White House are wearing pink pussyhats and posing for photos with marchers.

How amazing it is to see women, people of color, police and partisans alike come together for one common mission. With the next four years hanging over our heads, more instances like this will be crucial to taking back power in Washington and the state legislatures.To think that a demonstration organized by POC yielded the most peaceful of marches really puts a dent in the media (and the Trump Administration s) perception of minorities and those who protest.To paraphrase one attendee, it was a sea of humanism.The Women s March was, arguably, the largest and most peaceful demonstration in American history. The women of America (once again) showed their strength, and they should be so proud.While punches were thrown at Trump s rallies, hugs and high fives were given at the Women s March.

Trump to meet congressional leaders next week on legislative issues -White House,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.

South Koreans' support for nuclear projects deals blow to government energy plan,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean public support for nuclear power on Friday sucker punched a government policy to steer the country away from nuclear-generated electricity as Seoul said it would bow to a demand to resume construction of two new reactors.  President Moon Jae-in came to power in May, after running  on a ticket that called for reducing South Korea s nuclear and coal-fired power generation in a push to use more natural gas and renewables.  Those plans were dealt an unlooked-for blow on Friday when a public opinion survey found a majority of almost 60 percent in favour of resuming the stalled construction of two reactors.  Building the two reactors could mean reversal of a strategy to slowly reduce nuclear energy s share of the power mix, and also significantly eat into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand of the world s second-largest consumer of the fuel.   Our recommendation to the government is restarting construction,  said Kim Ji-hyung, chairman of a government-organised committee to study the nuclear projects.   Our final public opinion survey showed 59.5 percent of (responding) South Koreans chose to resume the construction,  Kim told a news conference.  Stability of power supply was cited as a primary reason for the choice in survey responses, the committee said.  We respect the will of the committee,  said South Korea s presidential office spokesman Park Soo-hyun.  An expert at a government think tank said the size of the win in favour of the projects meant the government had no choice but to go with the committee s recommendation.   The outcome was very unexpected ... Many expected the difference would be a maximum 10 percentage points, but as it turned out, it stood nearly at 20,  said Roh Dong-seok, senior research fellow at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.  The two 1,400-megawatt (MW) reactors - Shin Kori No.5 and Shin Kori No.6 - were originally to be completed by March 2021 and March 2022, respectively, in the southeastern city of Ulsan. The government announced a suspension of the projects after coming to power, saying it would consult the public over their future.  The committee conducted four rounds of surveys, including phone interviews of 20,006 people and public discussions involving some 470 citizens, over the past three months. With the reactors now likely going ahead, completion dates are set for October 2021 and October 2022, according to state-run nuclear operator Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power [KRHYDR.UL]. (For a graphic on 'South Korea 2016 power generation mix' click reut.rs/2xTOZKB)      Shares of Korea Electric Power Corp rose 0.6 percent to 41,110 won ($36.32) on Friday, after jumping nearly 6 percent following the announcement of the survey results.      KEPCO Engineering & Construction, in charge of the reactors  design, lost 1.2 percent after surging as much as 20 percent. KEPCO Plant Service & Engineering gained 1.7 percent.  Building nuclear power plants takes years, so the decision in favour of the two new reactors will not change South Korea s immediate fuel demand patterns.  But the vote, which surprised many in the industry, does impact the long-term outlook for the country s fuel consumption, with the biggest impact likely falling on imports of LNG.   Full implementation of Moon s election promises could have resulted in around 10 million tonnes (a year) of extra LNG demand by 2030. This now seems unlikely,  said Kiah Wei Giam, principal analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  That compares to South Korea s LNG imports of 33.4 million tonnes last year, according to customs data. [LNG/KRTRD] Giam said, however, the survey did not totally derail the government s energy policies.   With the planned nuclear phase-out delayed, it will be interesting to see whether more aggressive anti-coal policies are enacted,  Giam said.  Park Won-joo, Deputy Minister for Energy & Resources, said later at a briefing the government will reach a final decision on the nuclear reactors next Tuesday and then tell the state-run nuclear operator when to resume project construction.

" Cruz Makes Baffling Bestiality Joke About Trump, Marks New Low Point In Campaign","Ted Cruz has been on the warpath recently after Republican front-runner Donald Trump made several sexist comments about this wife. However, his tough guy act was tempered by the fact that his loyalty to the Republican Party meant that he would not refuse to vote for Trump if it came down to it. Instead, when asked point blank by a reporter whether he would support Trump as nominee, Cruz fumbled for an answer and quickly became a laughingstock.In the days since, Cruz seems to have found a spine, and signaled that he would finally be ready to never vote for Trump, even if he wins the nomination. I don t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family,  Cruz told reporters at a news conference.At the event, Cruz also addressed rumors that he had had affairs with as many as five women by pinning the attacks on Trump. We have done nothing to his family, and we will not. But Donald was unhappy with the news of the day, unhappy with losing elections, was unhappy with his dangerous ignorance of foreign policy being revealed on the world stage, so he decided to engage in a personal attack directed at my wife,  Cruz saidBut Cruz had to ruin what could have been a moment that showed he had a bit of integrity by immediately making a bizarre bestiality joke directed at Trump that was just plain creepy. Another in a long line of examples of how something just seems  off  with Cruz. Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him. And this garbage does not belong in politics. Uh, what?Cruz had perhaps wanted to politely suggest that Trump was a  ratf*cker  (classy), but instead wound up seeming to suggest that he himself likes having sex with rats, just not rats named Trump.It was decidedly one of the lowest points in a presidential race that has featured more than its fair share of rock bottoms. Neither Trump nor Cruz seem to have any problem lying, cheating, or stealing their way to victory. As the two grow closer in the polls, the vicious attacks have become more personal and more ugly. It seems impossible to imagine a scenario where Republicans find a way to come together after this. Their two top prospects have run scorched earth campaigns against each others families and friends. The resentment will likely glow red hot for years.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"March 26, 2016",0
SARA CARTER Uncovers Explosive Evidence Of Violations Of American Civil Liberties By Obama [Video],"OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS: How scary is this to anyone who thinks the government can t spy on them: The justification for requesting unmasking (revealing your identity) can be as simple as claiming  the identity of the United States person (you) is necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance . It does sound far-fetched but just ask FOX News reporter James Rosen who was spied on by Obama. Yes, Barack Obama spied on Americans by using the excuse that it was  necessary  to expose the name of the person the NSA was spying on. In other words, the use of intelligence information was mishandled for political purposes by a dirt bag president who only knows Chicago politics So Obama spied on Trump, right? Well, if he spied on James Rosen then you know damn well he spied on Trump. Yes, this backdoor form of political espionage by an outgoing administration trying to monitor its successor on the world stage is as bad as it gets IT S BANANA REPUBLIC BAD  As his presidency drew to a close, Barack Obama s top aides routinely reviewed intelligence reports gleaned from the National Security Agency s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad, taking advantage of rules their boss relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, Circa has learned.Dozens of times in 2016, those intelligence reports identified Americans who were directly intercepted talking to foreign sources or were the subject of conversations between two or more monitored foreign figures. Sometimes the Americans  names were officially unmasked; other times they were so specifically described in the reports that their identities were readily discernible. Among those cleared to request and consume unmasked NSA-based intelligence reports about U.S. citizens were Obama s national security adviser Susan Rice, his CIA Director John Brennan and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch.Some intercepted communications from November to January involved Trump transition figures or foreign figures  perceptions of the incoming president and his administration. Intercepts involving congressional figures also have been unmasked occasionally for some time.The NSA is expected to turn over logs as early as this week to congressional committees detailing who consumed reports with unmasked Americans  identities from their intercepts since the summer of 2016.Read more: Circa News",Government News,"Mar 29, 2017",0

Trump's $250 billion China 'miracle' adds gloss to 'off-kilter' trade,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing. Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether. Watched by Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing Co, General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals. “This is truly a miracle,” China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing. The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world’s second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called “shockingly high” on Thursday. But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China’s ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the deals pointed to “a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship” between the two countries. “Yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China.” U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China. Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system. “(These deals) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship,” Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note. Some huge deals were announced. Among them is a 20-year $83.7 billion investment by China Energy Investment Corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia, a major energy producing state that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election. [ “The massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented,” West Virginia Secretary of Commerce H. Wood Thrasher said in a statement. It marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded China Energy, which formed from the merger of China Shenhua Group, the country’s largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp, one of China’s top five utilities. However, as is often the case during state visits, many of the deals were packaged as “non-binding” agreements, gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups, helping pump up the headline figure. “I am somewhat skeptical of such a large number,” Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been “positive”. “I suspect they might be primarily MOUs (memorandum of understandings) instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less.” Qualcomm signed non-binding agreements worth $12 billion with Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo, three Chinese handset makers that the firm said it had “longstanding relationships” with. Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China. Boeing announced a deal with state-run China Aviation Suppliers Holding Co to sell 300 Boeing jets with a valuation of $37 billion at list prices, though analysts said it was unclear how many of these were new orders.  “Interesting to see how many of those are past agreements/purchase orders repackaged. Beijing is a master of selling the same agreement 10 times,” former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo posted on Twitter. Speaking alongside Trump in Beijing as they announced the deals, Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States, and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led initiative. Trump made clear he blamed his predecessors, not China, for allowing the U.s. trade deficit to get “out of kilter”, and repeatedly praised Xi, calling him “a very special man”. “But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us,” Trump said.  Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit. Asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix American trade concerns in China, executives were cautiously optimistic. “Generally the sense was that this is all a good thing, and that’s great,” said Gentry Sayad, a Shanghai-based lawyer who attended the trade delegation event in Beijing.  “Now let’s see what really happens and whether or not the agreements signed during this trip can become a basis for a better bilateral trade relationship going forward.”  ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2017 ",1
Obama tells Trump to 'stop whining' over rigged election claims,"WASHINGTON/GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama lacerated Donald Trump on Tuesday over his repeated assertions that the Nov. 8 election is rigged against him, telling the Republican presidential candidate to “stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.” With opinion polls showing him falling further back against his White House rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump has intensified his allegations, although numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is rare. At a campaign rally in Grand Junction, Colorado, Trump continued his attack, saying, “The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters.” But he also used his speech to detail a new initiative if elected president: a constitutional amendment imposing term limits for members of Congress, six years for members of the House of Representatives, 12 years for members of the Senate. Obama was asked about Trump’s voter fraud assertions on Tuesday at a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden following meetings with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. He responded with a blistering attack on the Republican candidate, noting that U.S. elections are run and monitored by local officials, who may well be appointed by Republican governors of states, and saying that cases of significant voter fraud were not to be found in American elections. Obama said there was “no serious” person who would suggest it was possible to rig American elections, adding, “I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.” Trump, speaking at the Grand Junction rally Tuesday evening, said that Obama should stop campaigning for “Crooked Hillary” and “get out and work on jobs and work on the border.” Trump has raised the possibility for weeks of illegal activities that could tarnish the November election result, citing scant or questionable evidence, including the possibility of votes being cast by dead people, and he has urged his supporters to show up at polling locations on Election Day. He has sharpened his allegations even as Republican lawyers called his assertions unfounded. In a report titled “The Truth About Voter Fraud,” the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent. An August study by the Washington Post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014. Arizona State University studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates. In pointed remarks that were part civics lesson, Obama said that if Trump wins on Nov. 8, “It would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech” and “it would be my job ... and escort him over to the Capitol, in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power” at his swearing in. Trump’s vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, took a softer tone than Trump during a campaign appearance in North Carolina, saying he was “confident” that the integrity of the election will be ensured. But Pence added that “in recent years we’ve had instances, proven instances of voter fraud.” A number of Republican-led states, citing the need to prevent voter fraud, have passed laws with stricter identification requirements. But several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting.   Trump trails Clinton by 7 points in national opinion polls, according to an average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics. Over the last few weeks, Trump, who has never previously run for office, has been embroiled in one controversy after another, eclipsing policy issues such as taxes, trade, the economy and national security that normally dominate the final push in presidential campaigns. With three weeks left until Election Day and early voting both by mail and in person already under way in many states, Trump has been grappling with the fallout from the release earlier this month of a 2005 videotape in which he was heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances. He has said the remarks were just “locker room” talk and has strongly denied allegations by a string of women who have come forward since the video emerged to say Trump groped or touched them inappropriately, denouncing his accusers as liars and fame-seekers. The controversies will be the backdrop for the third and final of three presidential debates, to be held on Wednesday evening in Las Vegas. Trump was widely viewed as having been on the defensive during the first debate. He appeared to have improved his performance in the second debate, but according to polling, more voters saw Clinton as the victor. Wednesday’s debate, like the first one, will be a traditional format with the moderator posing all the questions. Topics chosen by moderator Chris Wallace include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots, and fitness to be president.  At Tuesday’s press conference, Obama also criticized Trump for his “continued flattery” of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying “it is out of step with” the country. Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader and on Monday suggested that if he wins next month he might meet the Russian leader before he is even sworn in as president.

 Bill Maher And Barney Frank Destroy GOP For Choosing Petty Politics Over Functioning Supreme Court,"Bill Maher and Barney Frank totally schooled Republicans on Friday night.The Real Time host began by asking his panel to help explain why Senate Republicans are being complete pricks about President Obama picking the next Supreme Court Justice.Maher pointed out that Republicans have wobbled since Obama picked centrist Judge Merrick Garland to replace recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia. Now they are saying they want to wait until the lame-duck period after the election to make a final decision.Of course, we all know why they want to do this all of a sudden. A centrist like Garland may be the best Republicans can get, especially if the Democrats retain the White House in November. If that happens we can expect Republicans to eagerly confirm Garland in order to prevent a more liberal nominee from being nominated. And if Republicans win the White House they ll wait until 2017 so a more conservative nominee can take the position instead.In other words, Republicans are playing a duplicitous game of politics and the GOP consultant on board the panel actually had the stones to admit that his party is playing politics in an effort to keep the Republican Party from blowing apart. Because if they balk now, they risk pissing off their conservative base. Mitch McConnell knows one thing very clearly,  Rick Wilson said.  If they allow an Obama justice to go forward at this point it will blow a gigantic hole in the Republican coalition like we have never seen before. They have drawn a bright line, they have sworn this is a line they re not going to cross  After Wilson said he s a  shameless political guy,  Maher chimed in by asking,  Aren t you an American first? Wilson responded by saying there is nothing in the Constitution keeping Republicans from doing what they are doing and that GOP leadership is telling the base that they ve drawn a line to keep President Obama from having a lasting legacy on the Supreme Court.Well, that didn t impress former longtime congressman Barney Frank. I spent 40 years as an elected official. I ran for office 20 times,  Frank told Wilson.  I understand the role of politics, but I am disappointed, Rick. The explicit elevation of the need of keeping your coalition together over the functioning of the federal government is awful. Frank went on to say that there is a need for an odd number of Justices on the Court because an even number could lead to tied rulings that don t settle cases and agreed that this is about restricting President Obama to a three year term. Yes, it s in the Constitution that Obama gets to make an appointment,  Frank continued.  And what McConnell is putting forward is a nonsense theory, namely that it s only a 3-year term. Frank also expressed his hope that Republicans would have taken the opportunity to to pull back from their rabid base a little bit because of Donald Trump but it appears they have no intention of doing that. Instead, they appear to be doubling down on their allegiance to the base at their peril.Maher then re-introduced a word he came up with years ago known as  blacktracking,  which is when Republicans change their mind because President Obama agrees with them. As it turns out, it happened again this week because Republicans had no problem with Merrick Garland being nominated for the Supreme Court until President Obama nominated him this week.Here s the video via Twitter.Watch @BillMaher and the #RealTime panel discuss the GOP s  blacktracking  over @POTUS s SCOTUS nomination.https://t.co/5iiG9vrtBp  Real Time (@RealTimers) March 19, 2016 Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 19, 2016",0
China accuses Australia of paranoia over foreign influence laws,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - China accused Australia of hysteria and paranoia on Wednesday  after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull vowed to ban foreign political donations in a move to curb external influence on its domestic politics. Foreign powers were making  unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process  in Australia and the world, Turnbull told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. He had cited  disturbing reports about Chinese influence . The announcement came as concern grows that Beijing may be extending its soft power efforts in the country and as relationships between Australian politicians and Chinese government interests become increasingly contentious.  Some Australian media have repeatedly fabricated news stories about the so-called Chinese influence and infiltration in Australia,  the Chinese Embassy in Australia said in an English-language statement on its website.  Those reports, which were made up out of thin air and filled with cold war mentality and ideological bias, reflected a typical anti-China hysteria and paranoid (sic).   The statement said that  irresponsible remarks  by some Australian politicians and government officials had damaged trust between the countries and that it categorically rejected all allegations. China s soft power has come under renewed focus this week after a politician from Australia s opposition Labor party was demoted from government having been found to have warned a prominent Chinese business leader and Communist Party member that his phone was being tapped by intelligence authorities. In June, Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on a concerted campaign by China to  infiltrate  Australian politics to promote Chinese interests. Australia and neighboring New Zealand are among roughly a third of countries worldwide that allow foreign donations to political parties. Such donations are prohibited in the United States, Britain and several European countries. The new laws, modeled in part on the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, would criminalize foreign interference and require the registration of lobbyists working for nation states, Turnbull said.  China has no intention to interfere in Australia s internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations,  the embassy said.  We urge the Australian side to look at China and China-Australia relations in an objective, fair and rational manner.  ",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",1

YOU’LL NEVER GUESS Who The New York Times Is Blaming For North Korea’s Decades-Long Famine,"After North Korea s most recent missile launch, the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un claimed he had  finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.  US Defense Secretary James Mattis claimed that North Korea now has the ability to hit  everywhere in the world. Meanwhile, the New York Times is blaming the Trump administration for starving the North Koreans, after placing stricter sanctions on the rogue nation.The left-leaning New York Times bizarrely claimed this week that the decades-long famine plaguing North Korea is not the fault of its brutal communist regime, but most likely due to American interference and foreign policy, saying the  hunger is devastating. And it s our fault. The article, published over the weekend, lays the blame of millions of starved and tortured North Koreans at the feet of the American administration, saying the US and its allies have  crippled  Kim Jong Un s ability to feed his own people. Led by the United States, the international community is crippling North Korea s economy,  writes the author.  In August and September, the United Nations Security Council passed resolutions banning exports of coal, iron, lead, seafood and textiles and limiting the import of crude oil and refined petroleum products. The United States, Japan and South Korea have each imposed bilateral sanctions on Pyongyang to further isolate the country. We are trying to inflict pain on the North Korean regime to stop the development of nuclear weapons and missiles. That s understandable. But in the process, we are also punishing the most vulnerable citizens and shackling the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid to them,  the author adds.North Korea s massive food shortages date back to the 1990s when dictator Kim Jong Il s regime was incapable of handling droughts and other natural disasters that cut dwindling food supplies by over 30%.

"Explain your results, beaten Angola party head tells electoral commission","LUANDA (Reuters) - The leader of Angola s main opposition party called on the country s electoral commission on Saturday to explain how it compiled provisional election results giving the ruling MPLA party a landslide victory. Isaias Samakuva said his UNITA party, which has rejected the published results of Wednesday s national ballot, was conducting a parallel count using polling station records and computer software that did not tally with the commission s figures.  Where did those results come from?  Samakuva asked supporters at the party s campaign headquarters in Luanda.  The CNE (commission) must explain to Angolans what it did wrong and why it did it.  Based on nearly 98 percent of the vote counted, CNE figures announced on Friday put the People s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) on 61.1 percent and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) on 26.7 percent. Definitive results may not be announced until Sept. 6. International observers described the election as reasonably free and fair and the mood in Luanda has remained calm. UNITA said the results released so far were not legally binding and it would release its national tally early next week.  The country still doesn t have a President-elect,  Samakuva said. President-in-waiting Joao Lourenco, a former defense minister, is set to become the country s first new leader for 38 years, replacing Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who will continue as head of the MPLA. UNITA and smaller opposition party CASA-CE say the provisional results were processed without input from provincial counting centers or certain representatives on the electoral commission, going against Angolan law. The commission has said the process of vote-counting was  going well  but has not extensively explained how provisional numbers were tallied.  Even if the parties have summary records of the polling stations and minutes of electoral operations, it is necessary to realize there is another set of elements and documents that will contribute to the provincial and national tally and this information is not available to the parties,  commission spokeswoman Julia Ferreira said on Friday, without elaborating. UNITA published on Friday its parallel count for four provinces   Huambo, Bie, Cabinda and Luanda   which in all cases showed the party doing better than the commission results indicated. The MPLA, which emerged victorious over UNITA after 27 years of civil war in 2002, has dismissed the complaints, saying its old foe always take issue with election results.

Obama says China would not take change in U.S. policy on Taiwan lightly,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Friday it was fine for President-elect Donald Trump to review Washington’s “one-China” policy toward Taiwan, but he cautioned that a shift could lead to significant consequences in the U.S. relationship with Beijing. “For China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket,” Obama told a news conference. “The idea of one China is at the heart of their conception as a nation and so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what ... the consequences are.” China lodged a diplomatic protest earlier this month after Trump, a Republican, spoke by phone with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan. The 10-minute telephone call was the first of its kind by a U.S. president-elect or president since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of “one China”. China considers Taiwan a wayward province, to be taken back by force if necessary. Obama noted that, under the decades-old policy, China had recognized Taiwan was its own entity that did things its own way, while Taiwan had agreed that, with some autonomy, it would not declare independence. “That status quo, although not completely satisfactory to any of the parties involved, has kept the peace and allowed the Taiwanese to be a pretty successful ... economy and a people who have a high degree of self-determination,” Obama said. The Democratic president said he had advised Trump that foreign policy had to be conducted in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way. “There’s probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance and ... where there’s also the potential, if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full conflict mode, that everybody is worse off,” he said of the U.S.-China ties. He said Beijing would not treat a departure from U.S. policy toward Taiwan lightly. “The Chinese will not treat that the way they’ll treat some other issues. They won’t even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we’ve had a lot of tensions,” he said.  Taiwan reiterated it was committed to keeping the status quo in its relations with China and in promoting peace and stability, and thanked Washington for deepening U.S.-Taiwan relations. A statement from Taiwan’s Presidential Office said Tsai’s government looked forward to strengthening that relationship under Trump’s administration. ",politicsNews,"December 16, 2016 ",1
Australian former governor-general and peacemaker Ninian Stephen dies at 94,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Former Australian Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen, who worked on the Northern Ireland peace talks and served on the International Court of Justice, died on Sunday. He was 94. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced plans for a state funeral, saying there were very few honors that Stephen, who held five separate knighthoods, didn t have to his name.  Australia will remember Sir Ninian for his humility, his intellect, and his lifelong commitment to justice and the rule of law,  Turnbull said. Stephen served as governor-general from 1982 to 1989 when he became the first Australian Ambassador for the Environment, working hard to ban mining in Antarctica. He was born in Britain and moved to Australia in his late teens where he studied law before serving as an infantryman during World War Two, serving in New Guinea and Borneo. Both the British and Irish governments chose Stephen to chair the second phase of the Northern Ireland peace talks in 1992. He was also a judge for the International Criminal Tribunal investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. In his later years, he advised on South Africa s constitution, worked for the International Labour Organisation in Burma and was involved in setting up a tribunal to hear cases involving atrocities committed by the genocidal Khmer Rouge  killing fields  regime of 1975-79. He also helped draft a constitution for Afghanistan after the 2001 ouster of the Taliban.  ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Republicans may generate less heat at Miami debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates may find themselves in a more subdued debate than usual on Thursday night in Miami, since nothing Donald Trump’s rivals have thrown at him has made a major dent in his front-running campaign. After the histrionics of last week’s gathering in Detroit, the four remaining candidates are likely to search for higher ground as they offer closing arguments to Republican voters, particularly those in Florida and Ohio, who vote next Tuesday in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election.  The burden is particularly heavy on U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who must do well in their home states or face pressure to exit the race. While Kasich is holding his own against Trump in Ohio opinion polls, Rubio has lagged far behind Trump in Florida. Trump’s victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii on Tuesday added to his momentum after a week of attacks by mainstream Republicans who are offended by his statements on Muslims, women and illegal immigrants and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals. Trump defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on free trade on Thursday, saying the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations with other countries. He also cited currency devaluations as a particular problem. “I like free trade but you have to be represented by very, very good and smart and cunning people and we are not,” Trump said in an interview on CNBC. “Other countries are and that’s why they’re all taking advantage.” The tough-talking billionaire businessman told CNN on Wednesday he expected the debate to be a “nicer, softer, lighter debate, I hope.” But he added: “I’ll be ready. I’m the only one who can beat Hillary,” a reference to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. The tone could be set by Trump, 69, who forecast before several previous debates that he would take a more measured approach, only to quickly get into a verbal brawl with his rivals. The CNN-hosted debate will be held at the University of Miami at 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT on Friday). “I would focus on a positive uplifting message that takes us back to why they’re running for president and what’s at stake in this election,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. In Detroit last Thursday, Trump came under sustained fire from Rubio, 44, over parts of his business empire such as Trump University, a now-defunct venture that critics said offered a flimsy education. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas piled on Trump over his past support for Democratic causes. Trump blasted Rubio throughout the debate as a lightweight and Cruz as a liar. The Trump-Rubio debate clash in Detroit followed an abrupt change in Rubio’s campaign to begin raising personal questions about Trump, such as saying he had small hands, a statement Trump saw as a reference to his penis size. Rubio said he now regretted the personal insults. “In terms of things that have to do with personal stuff, yeah, at the end of the day, it’s not something I’m entirely proud of. My kids were embarrassed by it, and if I had to do it again, I wouldn’t,” Rubio told MSNBC on Wednesday. Cruz, 45, who would like to knock Rubio and Kasich out of the race so he could draw more support from anti-Trump Republican voters, will seek to use the debate to position himself as the best Trump alternative. “Trump is clearly trying to reach out and be a little more statesmanlike,” said Cruz backer Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. “Cruz is going to make the case as to why he can beat Trump and be the viable alternative. From our perspective, we think it’s a two-man race, we’re the only one with a path.” Rubio is fighting for survival and is facing something of a last stand in Florida. Rival campaigns said Rubio may feel a need to return to the optimistic message he stuck to for months before getting sidetracked by Trump. Rubio told Fox News on Wednesday the campaign was always going to come down to who wins Florida. “The nominee has to win Florida. You can’t be the Republican nominee if you don’t win Florida,” he said. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz have one shot at denying Trump the nomination - preventing him from assembling the required 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright, which would mean delegates would have to choose the nominee at their July 18-21 convention in Cleveland. Trump said on CNN on Wednesday that 1,237 was an “artificial number” and that if he entered the convention with more delegates than his rivals, he should be the nominee. While he has vowed to wage war against the party if he is denied the nomination at the convention, Kasich, 63, said it was possible for Republicans to have a contested convention and emerge united. “Can you go to a convention and come out united? Absolutely,” he told a Fox News town hall on Wednesday.

"How TYSON FOODS Is DESTROYING Small Towns…Forcing Taxpayers To Pick Up Housing, Healthcare Costs For Muslim Refugees","This is a story you won t likely find anywhere else, as both political parties seem to be okay with the import of low wage workers from foreign countries. Meanwhile, we have millions of American citizens who have given up any hope of finding a job, and many more who are being paid more by our government to stay home. LEXINGTON, Neb.   The old Longhorn Laundry is an unlikely place for a showdown over the First Amendment.You could easily miss the nondescript concrete building on a quiet downtown corner of this old cow town.But ever since a group of Somali workers from the local meatpacking plant spread out a sea of Persian rugs in the expansive former laundry and began holding Muslim prayer services five times a day, there has been controversy.City officials maintain that mosque leaders are ignoring local zoning laws and thumbing their noses at requirements for building permits and fire-code inspections.They insist that the flap is about a lack of parking, not a denial of religious freedom, and that it wasn t spurred by  Islamophobia. The attraction is employment at Tyson Foods:African Muslims, mostly from war-torn Somalia, started arriving in the mid-2000s. Census estimates put the number of Somalis in Lexington at 769 in 2014   a 40 percent increase from 2000. Local Somalis and those who work with them say there actually may be 1,500 or more living in the community.Across Nebraska, census estimates show 2,100 Somali-born residents clustered in Omaha and Lincoln, and near meatpacking plants in Grand Island and Madison, as well as Lexington.Since Obama was elected, Nebraska has  welcomed  6,716 refugees and the numbers have been increasing each of those years.Most of the refugees (seeded in Nebraska by federal  church  contractors) are Burmese or Iraqis, but of course Somalis have been resettled as well. (There are small numbers of Muslim Burmese and the largest group of Iraqis we admit to the US are Muslims. Somalis are virtually all Muslim.)For centuries, immigrants in search of a better life have been drawn to America s largest cities. Now, in part because of the meatpacking industry, recent immigrants have been seeking out small, rural towns. But many of these towns are struggling to provide the social services needed by such a diverse population that s largely invisible to most Americans.Noel, Mo is one of those small towns in America affected by the huge influx of mostly Somalian Muslim immigrants.Noel, Mo., has been dubbed the  Christmas City  and  Canoe Capital of the Ozarks  thanks to the Elk River, which winds through town. But this Missouri town of fewer than 2,000 residents thrives because of the Tyson Foods Inc. chicken processing complex located here it alone employs about 1,600 people. Just 20 years ago, Noel had only about half as many residents, and most of them were white. Then in the 1990s, Hispanics most of them Mexican moved to Noel to process chicken. Pacific Islanders and refugees from parts of Myanmar and Africa followed. We do have small towns that have had 100 to 200 percent growth that have really changed overnight over the past 20 years and have a much larger immigrant population than they used to,  says Lisa Dorner, a University of Missouri education professor who has done extensive research on immigrant children growing up in small towns and suburbs. Dorner thinks such major demographic changes don t always sit well with local residents.How on earth our federal CHURCH contractors can be aiding and abetting this travesty continues to be beyond my understanding.From Progressives for Immigration Reform (emphasis RRW):In her NPR news story, In A Small Missouri Town, Immigrants Turn To Schools For Help, writer Abbie Fentress Swanson chronicles the plight of newly arrived immigrants to the small, rural town of Noel, Missouri. It seems that longtime residents there are not dealing well with sudden demographic changes. Consequently, immigrants from Mexico, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, and the Pinglap region of Micronesia are among those feeling unwelcome and isolated in this formerly white community, which saw its population double to 2,000 in just two decades.Many of these immigrants are so poor they cannot afford housing or healthcare. Their children often lack shoes and clothes. As Swanson notes, about 90% of the community s children would go hungry most of the school day, if they didn t qualify for free or low-cost meals. With such an influx of people, Noel has not been able to keep up with providing social services. There is a long wait list for units from the local housing authority, and building more housing would strain the town s sewer system, already at 80% capacity.Immigrants are attracted to Noel by jobs at the chicken processing plant of Tyson Foods, which employs 1,600 people. The starting wage is a paltry $9.05 per hour, which comes to $362 a week before taxes for an eight-hour, five-day week. Despite health and injury risks to workers in this industry, Swanson calls this a  decent  wage and declines to hold Tyson culpable for perpetuating widespread misery in the cash-strapped town.The nation s largest U.S. meat processor by sales can easily afford to pay its employees in Noel a living wage, but prefers to have the community subsidize the resulting human wreckage. After all, profit is the overriding goal, even if it must be achieved by driving wages so low that most American citizens no longer can afford to work at its processing plants. No matter   the continuous stream of cheap, compliant foreign labor will do just fine. The results are compelling .The Mayor of Noel, MO, John Lafley says Tyson Foods is pushing the town to allow for more housing development, but he s concerned that Noel s infrastructure can t handle more units.The schools system (66% minority children!) has become the de facto social services department trying to stem poverty in the immigrant households.The mayor says there s no money in the budget either to provide the social services needed in this small, remote town, which sits not far from the Missouri-Kansas-Arkansas-Oklahoma borders. For rural Missouri, Tyson plant jobs pay decent wages that start at $9.05 an hour. Still, poverty looms large here. About 90 percent of Noel school students qualify for free or reduced-cost meals. The number of homeless children has doubled in the past five years. Because the nearest food pantry and free clinic are miles away, many plant workers turn to their children s schools for help.Tyson Foods wants the town to build more housing, but the town can t afford the infrastructure costs.Affordable housing is also a problem here in Noel. There s a long waiting list for open units at the local housing authority. You cannot rent a house right now. If you look, try to find a house, you can t,  says Faisal Ali Ahmed, a Somali refugee who works the night shift at the Tyson plant as a forklift driver.  It s a very difficult life. If they shut down this company now, nobody stay in this bush.John Lafley, the mayor of Noel, says longtime residents need to be sensitized to immigrants  needs, and immigrants need to try to fit in. We re trying to assimilate people that don t understand the American way. And they want to keep their own ways, which is not that popular,  Lafley says.Lafley says Tyson Foods is pushing the town to allow for more housing development, but he s concerned that Noel s infrastructure can t handle more units.The schools system (66% minority children!) has become the de facto social services department trying to stem poverty in the immigrant households.The mayor says there s no money in the budget either to provide the social services needed in this small, remote town, which sits not far from the Missouri-Kansas-Arkansas-Oklahoma borders.

Then this:Assimilation is not the real problem facing Noel, Missouri nor is it street-level bickering about matters of race, religion and values. The larger issue is what to do about rogue corporations that run roughshod over small communities in pursuit of profit, little of which is invested locally. Of greater concern is that our government wants to overload the job market even more through mass immigration policies, which will lay waste to many more small communities throughout America.And, what do you do about federal contractors for the US State Department wearing the white hat of do-gooderism while helping Tyson Foods make the profit!For entire story: Refugee Resettlement Watch",left-news,"May 17, 2016",0
Denmark no longer to automatically accept U.N. refugee resettlement quota,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark will no longer automatically accept a quota of refugees under a U.N. resettlement program after passing a law on Wednesday that enables the government to determine how many can enter each year. Since 1989, Denmark has agreed to take 500 refugees a year selected by the United Nations under a program to ease the burden on countries that neighbor war zones.  But after the European migration crisis in 2015 brought almost 20,000 claims for asylum, Denmark has refused to take any U.N. quota refugees. Under the new law, the immigration minister will decide how many refugees will be allowed under the U.N. program, with 500 now the maximum except in an  exceptional situation .    It s hard to predict how many refugees and migrants will show up at the border to seek asylum, and we know it may be hard to integrate those who arrive here,  Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg said last month when her ministry proposed the law. The opposition Social-Liberal Party said opting out of the U.N. program would increase pressure on countries already accommodating large numbers of refugees, and the move could encourage other countries to follow suit. Last year, more than 6,000 people claimed asylum in Denmark. Between January and November this year just over 3,000 people did.   (Corrects throughout to show new law only applies to U.N. resettlement quota, not other refugee applications.) ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",1

This is a direct, frontal assault on White America by the hostile, occupation government in Washington, D.C. The authorities shoot and kill a White man for exercising civil rights while blacks, browns and their liberal enablers get protected and publicly lauded for exercising the same civil rights.A White patriot in Oregon gets a bullet. Non-white looters in Baltimore get  room to destroy.  The National Guard stands idly by and watches while blacks burn Ferguson. Politicians of both the GOP and Democrat varieties praise the non-white  protesters  causing chaos in cities all across America because, ya know,  Black Lives Matter.   White lives, however, are apparently expendable when the federal government wants to make a point about who s in charge.What s wrong with this picture, kinsmen?The obvious question to ask now is how many cops will be assassinated over the death of a right wing terrorist? Unlike the Black Lives Matter movement, right wing extremists ARE violent. Incredibly so. They re consumed with visions of a race war to  take back their country  from all of Those People and see anyone with a badge (or darker skin) as the enemy. The last time the FBI killed a right wing militant, they went on a rampage that ended with the Oklahoma City Bombing and dozens of dead children. The right is far more radicalized now and violence is inevitable.Will we continue to ignore right wing extremists and pretend that there isn t a burgeoning insurrection fueled by racism in America?

U.S. judge unlikely to remove block on Trump sanctuary city order,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he was “very much inclined” to maintain a court order that blocks President Donald Trump’s administration from carrying out a policy designed to threaten federal funds to so-called sanctuary cities. At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, U.S. District Judge William Orrick III said a recent memo from the Justice Department that appeared to narrow the scope of Trump’s executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for an injunction. Trump issued the order in January directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing “sanctuary” movement. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. The Republican president’s moves to crack down on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court.  After Trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order earlier this year, Santa Clara County - which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities - sued, saying it was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. In a ruling in April, Orrick said Trump’s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. Attorney General Jeff Sessions then issued a memo which formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of Trump’s order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs. In court on Wednesday, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate said the Sessions memo meant less than a million dollars were now at risk for Santa Clara County and San Francisco, so the injunction was no longer needed. But Orrick said an injunction was still necessary because Trump could always order Sessions to issue new, broader guidance. “The attorney general still has the ability to change that memo,” Orrick said. The judge said he would also likely reject a Justice Department request to dismiss other claims by Santa Clara and San Francisco.       ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2017 ",1

The New Cold War: A Chilling Prospect for the World,"21st Century Wire says There is one curious thing the Presidents of your country [US] change but the policy doesnt change, on matters of principle.  ~ President PutinNATO s justification lies in its ability to find or create an enemy, Putin told legendary film maker, Oliver Stone. No other  enemy  has served NATO and the military industrial complex as well as Russia and the  Cold War . The re-emergence of the cold war construct has reached almost unprecedented levels with western media & governments bearing down on historic prejudices with renewed vigour. The new  cold war  is a chilling prospect for the world if it is allowed to mushroom into something more deadly.Finian Cunningham discusses this prospect in his article for Strategic Culture:On the passing of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Russia s President Vladimir Putin spoke fondly of the great statesman and his herculean efforts to reconcile Europe and Russia. Putin said he agreed with the late German leader s view that the Cold War between West and East had been largely brought to an end. The Russian president added, however, that international relations are bound to swing like a pendulum, oscillating between bad and good. Now the pendulum has swung a bit back towards frost, but I am convinced that it will inevitably find the right balance and we will be joining efforts to face today s challenges , Putin told reporters.This is commentary not meant to be pedantic nitpicking, but there are important reasons to point out why the pendulum analogy is mistaken. That model for relations is based on the false assumption that the dynamic can go from bad to good, and vice versa.If we take the peak of the Cold War running from the 1950s to the end of the 1980s, during which there was the constant specter of nuclear war, then if the pendulum analogy holds, one would expect that there should be at some stage of history an opposite state of relations in which mutual, peaceful coexistence eventually prevails.Unfortunately, history has shown us that more than 25 years after the presumed end of the Cold War, relations between the West and Russia have not proceeded towards any substantial improvement. Indeed, it seems clear that over the past five years or so, relations between the West and Russia have deteriorated to a level of hostility comparable to the peak of the Cold War.This grim condition of relations is illustrated by the constant imposition of new economic sanctions on Russia by the US and its European allies ever since the Ukraine conflict erupted in early 2014. Also, the relentless build-up of military forces by the US-led NATO alliance on Russia s border. In the past week, a NATO F-16 warplane made the highly provocative move of buzzing the aircraft carrying the Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu while in international airspace over the Baltic Sea.President Putin last week in an interview aired with American film-maker Oliver Stone deplored the possibility of a nuclear war, saying that nobody would survive such a catastrophic event. It is a measure of how foreboding relations between the West and Russia have become when Putin is obliged to make such a dire warning.The Russian leader went on to point out, rightly, that NATO always needs to find an enemy in order to justify its existence. The military organization   despite claims of protecting Atlantic security   is wired for war ever since its inception in 1949.So, let s not delude ourselves. The question of whether the Cold War ended around 1990 or not seems incontestable. It didn t. That war continues   albeit expressed in different ideological language and propaganda terms.Instead of alleged Soviet Marxist-Leninist expansionism, we hear of accusations that Moscow is  undermining the liberal world order  and  interfering in Western democratic elections . Or, allegedly, that Russia is threatening the security of the Baltic states.This is not to dispute the genuine convictions and sentiments of many Western and Russian politicians for global cooperation. There seems little doubt that the late, great German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wholly believed in a vision of West-East reconciliation and unity. During his 16-year leadership (1982-1998), Kohl oversaw the reunification of West and East Germany and he spoke of a future where Europe and Russia would work together.Putin reflected on personal conversations he shared with the German statesman.  Unfortunately, not everything from the dreams, we used to dream and talk about, is being implemented. However, I am convinced that his [Kohl s] analysis is correct and those positive processes, without which neither Europe nor Russia has any future, will be developing in the European and, I can say, Eurasian continent , remarked the Russian president.The question is: why have these reasonable, laudable aspirations not been implemented?And this leads us to the nature of US leadership among the Western states. American dominance is about hegemony and maintaining control over its perceived unipolar position of global power. This worldview in turn stems from the condition of American-led Western capitalism. It is a zero-sum worldview in which a multi-polar world is simply not tolerable. American domination necessarily dictates to subordinates, not  allies .The emergence of other world powers   no matter how legitimate that emergence is   is seen as a threat to American hegemony and the hierarchical structure of the capitalist world economy in which US interests are the apex of importance.American-led antagonism towards Russia did not originate after the Second World War as conventionally thought. It began with the Russian revolution in 1917 and the fear of international communism spreading to threaten the capitalist order. While modern-day Russia does not profess to be  socialist , and China s polity is debatable, both are nevertheless still perceived as a threat to the American unipolar worldview because they represent a multipolar rivalry.The only period during which Washington appeared to extend a non-hostile hand towards Russia was during the Boris Yeltsin leadership years of the 1990s when Russia was in effect a vassal state for US-led Western capitalism. Under the later more independent political leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which Russia has repudiated vassal status, the US has reverted to its standard position of overt hostility.Thus, the Cold War was definitely not ended. It was merely suspended for those years when Russia was subservient. Now that Russia is no longer subservient, the US-led Cold War is resumed.Western politicians like Helmut Kohl and some present-day European leaders may sincerely aspire to a normalization of relations between the West and Russia. Of course, it is a reasonable aspiration given the common history, culture and mutual economic interests. However, the relations between the West and Russia, and for that matter other global powers such as China, will always be subject to hostility. That is because of the intrinsic hegemonic condition of US-led Western capitalism demanding total dominance.The analogy of relations modulating like a pendulum between negative and positive, or good and bad, or war and peace, is flawed. Because relations under a sought-after unipolar world of American domination will inevitably be subject to antagonism and, if needs be, all-out conflict and war.Rather than a pendulum, perhaps a more fitting analogy is a giant wrecking ball. The would-be American hegemonic power says:  Do as I demand and the wrecking ball is held back. If not, then here comes the force of destruction .How to transcend this appalling situation is the challenge of our times. But one surmises that the emancipation depends on ending American-led capitalism and its hegemonic dictate to the rest of the world.***TO READ MORE ON THE NEW COLD WAR: THE 21WIRE COLD WAR FILESSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"June 24, 2017",0
Democrats ask Trump to veto measure repealing city retirement plan rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a last-ditch effort, five U.S. Senate Democrats are urging President Donald Trump to veto a resolution that would repeal a Labor Department rule designed to help cities launch retirement savings plans for low-income private-sector workers by exempting such programs from strict federal pension protection laws. In an April 5 letter that Reuters saw on Thursday, the lawmakers told Trump, a Republican, that killing the rule could harm more than 2 million Americans who would otherwise benefit from city-run retirement plans. “We ask you to work with us to increase access to retirement savings programs and promote greater retirement security,” they wrote. The senators signing the letter are Patty Murray of Washington and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrats on committees overseeing pensions and tax matters; Maria Cantwell of Washington; Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; and Robert Casey of Pennsylvania. The resolution on city-run retirement plans is one of 13 measures that Congress has passed to repeal rules enacted under previous president Barack Obama, a Democrat. An obscure law called the Congressional Review Act gives Congress a tool to repeal regulations that it finds objectionable. All that is required is a simple majority vote in both chambers and the president’s signature. The law is limited, however, in how it can be used. Only rules that were finalized within 60 legislative days are eligible for repeal. Trump has signed 11 of the 13 resolutions so far.  The White House Office of Management and Budget has advised Trump to sign the city-run retirement plan measure, and a White House official said on Wednesday that the president would sign more resolutions this month.  The Labor Department adopted two rules at the end of Obama’s tenure that exempted both city and state-run retirement plans from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, a law designed to protect workers’ savings. The plans are geared toward private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and would let them enroll automatically in plans like those being introduced in places like California. Cities and states say they need the exemption for the plans to work effectively, but trade groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Investment Company Institute want it repealed amid concerns that workers would not have adequate pension protections. The resolution to repeal the city-run retirement plan rule narrowly passed the Senate in a 50-49 vote.  The Senate is expected to take up a separate resolution to repeal the rule on state-run retirement plans after the Easter recess. ",politicsNews,"April 6, 2017 ",1
U.S. quits talks on global migration pact over sovereignty clash,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has quit negotiations on a voluntary pact to deal with migration because the global approach to the issue was  simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty,  said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.  In a statement released late on Saturday, the U.S. mission to the U.N. noted that President Donald Trump made the decision.   No country has done more than the United States, and our generosity will continue,  said Haley, whose parents are immigrants from India.  But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.    We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country,  she said. Trump campaigned last year on a promise to deport large numbers of immigrants and build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to help tackle illegal immigration and crime in the United States. Since he took office in January, he has also moved to ban U.S. entry by people from select Muslim countries.  With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, the 193-member U.N. General Assembly adopted a political declaration in September last year in which they also agreed to spend two years negotiating the pact on safe, orderly and regular migration. Former U.S. President Barack Obama s administration backed the resolution, known as the New York Declaration, which also asked U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi to propose a global compact on refugees for adoption in 2018.   The global approach in the New York Declaration is simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty,  Haley said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres regretted the U.S. decision, his spokesman said on Sunday, but expressed hope the United States might re-engage in the talks.  The positive story of migration is clear: it needs to be better told. Equally, the challenges it throws up need to be tackled with more determination and greater international coordination,  U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said. Three days of preparatory talks begin in Mexico on Monday ahead of the start of formal negotiations in February over the non-binding pact.  Haley s predecessor Samantha Power mocked the U.S. move.  How to further insult your Mexican neighbor, turn your back on humanity s most desperate, and make America irrelevant on a hugely destabilizing global crisis in one easy step,  she posted on Twitter.  While former U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said on Twitter:  On migration, national solutions logically do not exist ... Going it alone is a lose-lose proposition.  (The story was refiled to correct the name of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to Filippo Grandi from Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein in paragraph 7) ",worldnews,"December 3, 2017 ",1
Fake letters tell Germans the web has worked out their vote,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Wednesday they were investigating letters telling voters that their political preferences had already been worked out from their internet postings and there was no need to go to the polls on Sunday. Some of the fake letters carried the logo of federal election authorities, meaning the sender could be guilty of forgery, said the state prosecutor s office in Wiesbaden. The messages were crude and  it would be surprising if people fell for it , a spokesman for the federal election director said.  Still, it s frustrating.  There was no indication of who was behind the letters, and they appeared to be based on a recent joke in a German magazine. But German government officials and security experts have been on the look out for evidence of meddling ahead of the Sept. 24 national vote, following allegations of Russian interference in polls in the United States and France. German computer magazine c t carried a satirical article this month in which a fictional voter is told that their vote will be automatically cast for a certain party given their behavior on the internet and credit card charges. The actual letters sent to German voters suggested the voters would cast their ballots for the  Party of Bible-abiding Christians  or the  Basic Wage Coalition,  RND newspapers reported. Prosecutors said the investigation started after a complaint from the German federal election director, whose office is in Wiesbaden.  The letters looked real, which is why we are investigating possible forgery of documents,  a spokesman for the prosecutor s office said. ",worldnews,"September 20, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources," WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration wants to revamp and rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on Islamist extremism, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters.  The program, “Countering Violent Extremism,” or CVE, would be changed to “Countering Islamic Extremism” or “Countering Radical Islamic Extremism,” the sources said, and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States.  MORE For hardline West Bank settlers, Jared Kushner's their man Iranians fear attacks and economic isolation as Trump talks tough Republicans wrestle with effort to cut Obamacare Such a change would reflect Trump’s election campaign rhetoric and criticism of former President Barack Obama for being weak in the fight against Islamic State and for refusing to use the phrase “radical Islam” in describing it. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in several countries.  The CVE program aims to deter groups or potential lone attackers through community partnerships and educational programs or counter-messaging campaigns in cooperation with companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O).  Some proponents of the program fear that rebranding it could make it more difficult for the government to work with Muslims already hesitant to trust the new administration, particularly after Trump issued an executive order last Friday temporarily blocking travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  WATCH Uber CEO quits Trump advisory board Still, the CVE program, which focuses on U.S. residents and is separate from a military effort to fight extremism online, has been criticized even by some supporters as ineffective.  A source who has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the program said Trump transition team members first met with a CVE task force in December and floated the idea of changing the name and focus.   In a meeting last Thursday attended by senior staff for DHS Secretary John Kelly, government employees were asked to defend why they chose certain community organizations as recipients of CVE program grants, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.  Although CVE funding has been appropriated by Congress and the grant recipients were notified in the final days of the Obama administration, the money still may not go out the door, the source said, adding that Kelly is reviewing the matter.  The department declined comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Some Republicans in Congress have long assailed the program as politically correct and ineffective, asserting that singling out and using the term “radical Islam” as the trigger for many violent attacks would help focus deterrence efforts.  Others counter that branding the problem as “radical Islam” would only serve to alienate more than three million Americans who practice Islam peacefully.  Many community groups, meanwhile, had already been cautious about the program, partly over concerns that it could double as a surveillance tool for law enforcement.  Hoda Hawa, director of policy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said she was told last week by people within DHS that there was a push to refocus the CVE effort from tackling all violent ideology to only Islamist extremism.  “That is concerning for us because they are targeting a faith group and casting it under a net of suspicion,” she said.  Another source familiar with the matter was told last week by a DHS official that a name change would take place. Three other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such plans had been discussed but were unable to attest whether they had been finalized.  The Obama administration sought to foster relationships with community groups to engage them in the counterterrorism effort. In 2016, Congress appropriated $10 million in grants for CVE efforts and DHS awarded the first round of grants on Jan. 13, a week before Trump was inaugurated.  Among those approved were local governments, city police departments, universities and non-profit organizations. In addition to organizations dedicated to combating Islamic State’s recruitment in the United States, grants also went to Life After Hate, which rehabilitates former neo-Nazis and other domestic extremists.  Just in the past two years, authorities blamed radical and violent ideologies as the motives for a white supremacist’s shooting rampage inside a historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina and Islamist militants for shootings and bombings in California, Florida and New York.  One grant recipient, Leaders Advancing & Helping Communities, a Michigan-based group led by Lebanese-Americans, has declined a $500,000 DHS grant it had sought, according to an email the group sent that was seen by Reuters. A representative for the group confirmed the grant had been rejected but declined further comment.   “Given the current political climate and cause for concern, LAHC has chosen to decline the award,” said the email, which was sent last Thursday, a day before Trump issued his immigration order, which was condemned at home and abroad as discriminating against Muslims while the White House said it was to “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals.”  ",politicsNews,"February 1, 2017 ",1
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE 2006 SECURE BORDER FENCE ACT?,"Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank Obama and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.OBAMA CLAIMED: We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.THE  SECURE FENCE ACT The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh.PROMINENT REPUBLICAN FROM TEXAS:The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried. Via: The Lid",Government News,"Aug 16, 2015",0
 National Security Expert Warns Of The DIRE Dangers Of Trump’s Plan For Intel Community (VIDEO),"For the first time in our lives, we are entering an era where we have elected a president who is downright dangerous. Donald Trump is petty, childish, ignorant, thin-skinned, vengeful, and a wannabe dictator   and he will soon be the most powerful man on the planet. Well, it seems that there are some highly respected people who realize this, and hopefully they can keep us all safe during this travesty of a presidency. One such person is national security expert and former intelligence officer Malcolm Nance.Nance sat down for a chat with MSNBC s Joy Reid on Saturday morning, and he did not mince words when it came to the dangers of Trump, and what he believes the incoming president-elect strongman has in store for America s top spy agencies. First, Reid began: Let s just get to Donald Trump s refusal to be able to accept, Malcolm, the conclusions of the intelligence community even when the head of the intelligence agencies are sitting in front of him telling him this happened. Why in your view will he not just accept it? Nance s reply was most ominous: I think because, when Donald Trump made his statement on July 27th of last year where he asked for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and release her e-mails, at that point he went from being an unwitting useful idiot to Russia to actually believing that they were working in his favor. To admit that now, in the face of all the evidence, he would believe that this would delegitimize his presidency and he will fight to the end to not allow this to become a narrative. Of course he will. It s a telltale trait of people with authoritarian tendencies to be unable to have their legitimacy questioned for any reason whatsoever. Trump will stop at nothing to prevent the media from talking about this. Hell, given his constant attacks on them, he may even try to use the power of the presidency to prohibit there being any sort of check on him for any reason, but especially when it comes to Russia.Nance continued: I suspect that in two weeks he s going to attempt to cover this all up and even gut the intelligence community. He is pushing this nation to a constitutional crisis of unprecedented magnitude, because no one has ever worked in the interests of a hostile nation and supporting, to a certain extent, a hostile intelligence service. Nance is exactly right. Trump is dangerous. He is looking to serve his own interests, not those of the United States of America. Should he continue along this path   and we know that he will   the people in a position of power to do something about him better damn well do it fast, lest he shred the Constitution and destroy American democracy forever.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 7, 2017",0

French government spokesman gets Macron's backing to lead party,"PARIS (Reuters) - French government spokesman Christophe Castaner said on Wednesday that Emmanuel Macron was backing him to lead the year-old Republic on the Move (LREM) party that brought the president to victory earlier this year. If Castaner wins a Nov. 18 election for the party s leadership, it could trigger a minor government reshuffle as he is a cabinet member in charge of relations with parliament. LREM won a large majority in parliamentary elections in June, consolidating Macron s presidential win in May. Like Macron, most LREM lawmakers had never previously held elected office.  If he chose me and supported my candidacy in the collective talks we re having, it s because I ve got the support of the party s rank and file,  Castaner said on RTL radio. Previously a Socialist lawmaker from southwestern France, Castaner joined Macron s campaign early as his spokesman. Since Macron s victory, Castaner has become a familiar face on national television defending the president s reform agenda. Thanks to Castaner s Socialist roots, Macron s backing for him could help counter recent criticism of Macron as a president of the rich for partially scrapping the wealth tax, a symbol of France s income redistribution system cherished on the Left. Castaner said that for the moment no one else had put forward their candidacy to lead the party. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
U.S. diplomacy with North Korea to continue until 'first bomb drops': Tillerson,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday that President Donald Trump had instructed him to continue diplomatic efforts to calm rising tensions with North Korea, saying “those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.” Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Tillerson downplayed messages that President Trump had previously posted on Twitter suggesting Tillerson was wasting his time trying to negotiate with “Little Rocket Man,” a derogatory nickname Trump has coined for North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un. Trump “has made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts,” Tillerson said. Tillerson’s comments Sunday come amid soaring tensions between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a war of words between the two countries’ leaders. North Korea has conducted a series of nuclear tests in recent weeks and ago and launched two missiles over Japan. Tillerson has been in talks with China to enlist its help on getting North Korea to back down.  But Trump’s recent Twitter messages appeared to undercut Tillerson’s efforts, prompting the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker to complain that Trump was publicly castrating Tillerson and hurting diplomatic talks. Tillerson downplayed those tweets Sunday, telling CNN that Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping have an extremely close relationship and that China understands the U.S. position. “Rest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way” about the American policy towards North Korea, he added.

 Trump Bragged That He Likes To Go To Russia Because The Women ‘Have No Morals’ (AUDIO),"Donald Trump may deny that he hired some Russian prostitutes to empty their bladders for him, but an exchange from  The Howard Stern Show  in 2001 really makes it seem like that s the sort of thing he s into. During a backhanded catfight with gossip columnist A.J. Benza over a woman they had both slept with, Benza hit Trump with a pointed jab about his preference for Russian women as well as a quote that may have seemed meaningless then but takes on special meaning in light of his  golden showers  fiasco.After Trump bragged that he  took  Benza s girlfriend, this happened:Trump: I assume A.J. s clean. I hope he s clean.Benza: Meanwhile, he bangs Russian people Stern: Russian people?Trump: Who are you talking about, Russian people, A.J.? I don t know anything.Benza: He used to call me when I was a columnist and say,  I was just in Russia, the girls have no morals, you gotta get out there.  [Trump s] out of his mind.Trump did not deny making the statement.On Wednesday, a British news anchor revealed that there are not one but multiple sources confirming that Donald Trump has been caught in  compromising situations  with Russian women. In fact, there may be more information than we know (including video and audio). I saw the report, compiled by the former British intelligence officer, back in October,  BBC correspondent Paul Wood said. He is not, and this is the crucial thing, the only source for this.  Wood said that he reached out to the U.S. intelligence community and  got a message back  from a contact that there is more than one tape, not just video, but audio as well, on more than one date, in more than one place, in both Moscow and St. Petersburg.

HUD SECRETARY BEN CARSON Ending Obama’s Illegal Section 8 Housing Grant Scheme,"After his reelection in 2012 Obama removed the bidding process from section 8 housing. Obama then schemed to provide HUD initiated grants to their  pet  organizations. After lawsuits and ultimately with the Supreme Court rebuking the grant-style process, HUD Secretary Ben Carson is bringing back a more efficient bidding process that also saves taxpayer dollars. Great job Dr. Carson!The Department of Housing and Urban Development is poised to reverse the Obama administration s policy and return to a competitive bidding process to award Section 8 housing, according to a well-placed source in the department.The move would overturn the Obama-era methodology of using a grant-style process that was rebuked by administrators and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.The HUD official said many of the steps necessary to change back to the competitive procurement method are being taken now, but didn t want to comment on when the announcement from the department might happen for fear of tainting the bidding process.Supporters of the competitive bidding procurement process say the net result will increase efficiency in the program and save taxpayer money. And Republican lawmakers that have been critical of HUD s actions in the past are applauding the change in course as well. When dealing with performance-based Section 8 contract administrators, it s clear that full and open competition is the way to get the best value for the taxpayer,  said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.  As Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I have repeatedly insisted both publicly and privately that HUD follow Congressional intent, the GAO, and the Supreme Court. Diaz-Balart is one of a small handful of elected officials who put pressure on HUD and then-Secretary Juli n Castro during the years in which HUD ignored findings that their grant process was illegal.Section 8 housing is a federal program that pays rental assistance to landlords to help low-income people acquire affordable housing.Because HUD had problems administering the program, in 1995 it started to contract out the management of Section 8 housing units through a competitive bidding process. However, in March of 2012, HUD suddenly shifted away from the competitive bidding process, and began using funding mechanisms which were more like grants.Contractors who had previously gained HUD s business under the bidding process appealed to the Government Accountability Office in 2012, just months after HUD changed course. And by August of that year, the GAO ruled that HUD s actions were  unreasonable and in disregard of applicable statutory guidance. Undeterred, HUD pressed forward with their choice, which then made them the target of a lawsuit. From that point, HUD lost an embarrassing string of rulings which culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court denying to hear an appeal from the agency in April of 2015.Despite all those rulings, HUD didn t budge. But the Trump administration is now set to return to the previous methods.Eric Strong is the CEO of Navigate Affordable Housing Partners, a company that has won HUD Section 8 contracts in the past under the competitive system.

Tillerson tightens the reins at State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month tightened his control over the State Department by taking back powers previously held by the top career foreign service officer, an action critics said would delay major decisions and marginalize career diplomats. The move retracted broad decision-making authority granted to the agency’s third-highest ranking official, the undersecretary for political affairs, by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Most of those powers will be reserved instead for Tillerson and his deputy. Tillerson is broadly reviewing how authority is delegated, a State Department official said, which will “result in a streamlining of delegations, which will promote greater transparency, clarity and effectiveness in decision-making within the Department.”  On July 17, Tillerson reversed Clinton’s 2009 decision to empower the undersecretary for political affairs, currently career diplomat Thomas Shannon, with “all authorities and functions vested in the Secretary of State.” Former officials said Clinton’s delegation of authority was helpful in allowing decisions to be made quickly when she or her deputy were traveling abroad. “Everyone travels all of the time if you’re doing your job right as a diplomat,” said a former State Department official who served during the Obama administration and requested anonymity. “There has to be some delegation of authority, or the work simply doesn’t get done.” Tillerson’s decision came as most of the high-level positions at the State Department are either empty or filled by career officials in an “acting” capacity. The secretary has said he wants to be cautious about hiring while he is conducting a review of the State Department’s organization. On Tuesday, Tillerson acknowledged to reporters that “I have a lot of open slots,” but said he had been able to accomplish a great deal “because there are remarkable, talented professional foreign service officers in this building.” But the slow pace of appointments has logjammed decision-making and resulted in a rank-and-file bureaucracy disconnected from top officials, diplomats and some members of Congress said.  “We don’t know what the policies are, and the diplomats don’t know what the policies are,” Senator Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Tuesday. The second authority Tillerson took back from the undersecretary for political affairs in July was approval of State Department reports to Congress, which will now sit with the Office of Policy Planning, an internal State Department body usually headed by a political appointee. Unlike other senior officials, the office director and staff do not need Senate confirmation. The State Department is required by law to produce hundreds of reports for Congress each year, including on acts of terrorism, human rights conditions in different countries, countries’ narcotics control strategies, the state of religious freedom around the world, and human trafficking. Typically, such reports are prepared by offices and embassies with expertise in the relevant issue, and are reviewed by the State Department’s Bureau of Legislative Affairs and top aides to the secretary of state before being sent to Congress. Three former officials said giving the policy planning staff final sign-off on the reports could inject political considerations into their preparation. The undersecretary for political affairs is typically a career foreign service officer, and oversees seven regional bureaus. The move represents a “power grab” by the policy planning body, said Eliot Cohen, who served as State Department counselor during former President George W. Bush’s administration. “You need a strong undersecretary for political affairs,” Cohen said. “You can’t run the State Department with a tiny office ... you need to go out and establish good working relationships with the professionals of the department.” ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2017 ",1
Kerry launches talks with Venezuela but backs disputed referendum,"SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced high-level talks to ease tensions with Venezuela’s socialist government on Tuesday, just hours after he backed calls for a referendum that could force President Nicolas Maduro from office.   Kerry said the talks would start immediately in Caracas and be led by Thomas Shannon, a veteran of U.S. diplomacy in the region. Attempts last year at dialogue between the ideological foes were stalled by Venezuela’s deepening crisis. The two countries have been embroiled in diplomatic hostilities since the administrations of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and U.S. President George W. Bush. Kerry said the goal was to go beyond “the old rhetoric.” “I’ve committed to see if this can work so let’s see if we can improve the relationship,” he told reporters, after huddling with his Venezuelan counterpart on the sidelines of an Organization of American States (OAS) meeting in the Dominican Republic. The talks would also be aimed at fostering dialogue between Venezuela’s government and opposition, Kerry said. Maduro welcomed the proposed talks and repeated his suggestion that the two sides restore ambassadors in each other’s capitals after an eight-year hiatus that began when Chavez expelled the U.S. envoy to Venezuela. “I propose to John Kerry ‘let’s designate ambassadors’, I am ready. They have ambassadors in Beijing, Vietnam and Havana, and they don’t have one in Caracas,” he said in a speech to teachers. Maduro proposed an ambassador in 2014 but U.S. President Barack Obama has not yet accepted his credentials. Once one of Latin America’s most prosperous nations, Venezuela has plunged into unrest and a harsh economic slowdown. Long lines for food and medicines have led to protests and opposition calls for a recall referendum to remove Maduro.     That measure is allowed under the constitution, a point made by Kerry to reporters after he met Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez.  Earlier in the day, in a speech to OAS delegates, Kerry gave his backing to the referendum push and called on Chavez’s political heirs to release political prisoners and respect fundamental rights.      His comments to the 34 members of the main diplomatic body of the Americas marked the strongest show of support yet from the United States for the disputed referendum process. Venezuela’s opposition accuses the election council of stalling the recall at the behest of Maduro by arbitrarily changing criteria for requesting a recall vote. Maduro has said any recall against him would be in 2017 at the earliest, pushing back against opposition pressure. Several opposition politicians are in jail, notably hardline leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has a 14-year sentence for inciting 2014 anti-government protests that spiraled into violence killing more than 40 people. The government denies it holds political prisoners. Kerry’s comments drew a furious response from Rodriguez, who accused Washington and OAS chief Luis Almagro of “international bullying.”   “Every day we have evidence of the secretary general’s bias in favor of sectors of the opposition who are seeking a coup in Venezuela,” she said.  “I see now this is ordered by Washington. I know they are on Washington’s payroll to meddle in the domestic affairs of Venezuela,” she said, speaking through a translator.  Kerry was more conciliatory after his first ever bilateral meeting with Rodriguez, saying the United States did not support a push by Almagro to suspend Venezuela from the OAS for alleged violations of the regional group’s “democratic charter.” “The United States is not taking that position, we are not pushing for a suspension. I don’t think that would be constructive,” he said. At Almagro’s behest, the OAS will hold a meeting later this month to initiate the process that could end in Venezuela’s suspension. But the former Uruguayan foreign minister appears isolated in the group, with even right-wing governments opposed to Maduro in the region balking at throwing Venezuela out. Venezuela and the United States have repeatedly gone through periods of diplomatic fighting followed by generally short-lived eras of reconciliation.  Following Washington’s 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, Shannon met with a top Venezuelan Socialist Party official to improve ties with Caracas. The good mood soured within months when the United States criticized the sentence handed to opposition leader Lopez. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
"Scope of Kerimov's immunity status up to judge to decide upon, says France","PARIS (Reuters) - The scope of the immunity status accorded to Russian businessman and lawmaker Suleiman Kerimov, who has been arrested in France, is up to the French judge dealing with the matter to decide upon, said the French foreign ministry.  Kerimov was arrested by French police at Nice airport on Monday evening in connection with a tax evasion case, and the Kremlin said it would do everything in its power to defend his lawful interests.  It is up to the judge, who has been called upon in this case, to clarify whether the charges that have been brought against him are related to his official roles and would therefore be protected by diplomatic immunity,  said French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne.

 Man In ‘I Stand For The National Anthem’ Shirt Thinks American Flag Is A Lawn Chair,"You know how Trump supporters are screaming because brown people are protesting police violence and discrimination by peacefully kneeling for the National Anthem? Well, a photograph has surfaced that perfectly demonstrates the hypocrisy of the  fornicate with the flag  movement or whatever those screaming about it are calling themselves these days.Trump fans love to wave around their American flags while screaming  America First  but when you look at the respect conservatives actually show for their flag and country, you have to consider having a physician on standby to prevent you from dying of laughter.One right-wing  protester  wearing a shirt that says  I STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM  was captured at a Jets game Sunday casually lounging on the same American flag he waves as he claims he s the biggest patriot in the history of patriotism with his trusty beer next to him.Deadspin reports that the person who snapped the photo saw the spectacle as they were walking with a friend through the stadium during the third quarter of the game. There is a huge tv screen by the food carts right inside the stadium where people gather to watch. We went over there to check it out and we saw him spread the flag out and sit down,  they said.  I thought it was too ironic so I snagged a picture. He sat on it for a few minutes before leaving. This is the reality of the  Patriots  on the Right. They talk a big game whenever they see a rainbow American flag or whenever an an African-American person is kneeling in front of one as the National Anthem plays. But when it comes to respecting the flag   well, you see what happens.Featured image via screengrab",News,"October 16, 2017",0
Exclusive: Trump says Republican border tax could boost U.S. jobs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke positively about a border adjustment tax being pushed by Republicans in Congress as a way to boost exports, but he did not specifically endorse the proposal. Trump, who has lashed out at U.S. companies for moving operations and jobs to countries such as Mexico, had previously sent mixed signals on the proposal at the heart of a sweeping Republican plan to overhaul the tax code. “It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States,” Trump told Reuters in an interview, using his most approving language to date on the proposal. Trump sent conflicting signals about his position on the border adjustment tax in separate media interviews in January, saying in one interview that it was “too complicated” and in another that it was still on the table. The proposal has divided American businesses. Critics say the planned 20 percent tax on imports could be passed along in higher prices to consumers, including manufacturers that rely on imported goods to make their products. Some critics have warned of a potential global trade war which would sharply curtail U.S. and world economic growth. Advocates say U.S. exporters will gain as their revenues will be excluded from federal taxes. They say the tax on imports will encourage domestic production and cause the already strong dollar to rise, offsetting upward pressure on import prices. Trump has also called for a 35-percent border tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market. It has been unclear in the past if those references referred to the border adjustment proposal. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border,” he told Reuters on Thursday. “What is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, they’re going to build their factories and they’re going to create a lot of jobs and there’s no tax.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer also came to the defense of border adjustment on Thursday, disputing the claim that it could lead to higher consumer prices. “That benefits our economy, it helps American workers, it grows the manufacturing base,” Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing.         The Mexican peso MXN= weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar immediately after Trump's comments and was last trading at 19.68 per dollar. Earlier on Thursday, the Mexican currency hit its strongest level since Trump's Nov. 8 election victory. Stocks of retailers, which could be hurt by border adjustment, weakened on Wall Street after Trump’s remarks. The S&P 500 retailing index .SPXRT ended down 1 percent. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) slipped and closed down 0.6 percent. Trump said his administration will tackle tax reform legislation after dealing with Obamacare, the health insurance system that his fellow Republicans have bashed since it was put in place in 2010 by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Earlier on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC the Trump administration aimed to formulate a tax plan with support from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate and pass it before August. Lawmakers and corporate lobbyists say the border adjustment tax could die in Congress, potentially jeopardizing the prospects for tax reform, mainly because of opposition from a handful of Senate Republicans.  But experts say Trump’s endorsement could change the political climate. “If Trump supports it, that makes it considerably more likely,” Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai told Reuters. Trump’s comments were followed by dueling statements from lobbying groups.  A statement from the pro-border adjustment American Made Coalition said the White House was “sending its strongest signals yet that it’s leaning toward supporting the House blueprint with border adjustability.”  The Americans for Affordable Products coalition that opposes the border adjustment tax issued a statement saying Trump’s remarks were “consistent with what he’s already said” and that it was “impossible” to know if they were specific to any individual legislative policy.  Trump spoke to Reuters after meeting with more than 20 chief executives of major U.S. companies to discuss ways to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, one of the linchpins of his 2016 presidential campaign. Many CEOs of large multinationals back the border adjustment tax. The chiefs of 16 companies, including Boeing Co (BA.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N), sent a letter to Congress on Tuesday urging support for it. A border adjustment has emerged as the most controversial segment of the House Republican tax reform blueprint. Under the House plan, it would raise more than $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for a corporate tax cut. ",politicsNews,"February 23, 2017 ",1

"China's Guangdong gets new party boss, former leader likely to be promoted","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Saturday appointed a new top official for the southern export powerhouse province of Guangdong, whose former leader sources say is likely to be promoted to a vice premier, part of a reshuffle after the end of a Communist Party Congress. President Xi Jinping on Wednesday unveiled a new senior leadership at the end of the twice-a-decade congress, with new members appointed to the three elite party bodies that run China. Over the next few weeks and months, a series of other reshuffles will take place as the party moves people into new party and government positions and as others retire. In a brief statement, the official Xinhua news agency said that Li Xi had been moved from his post as party boss in the northeastern province of Liaoning to run Guangdong province as its party chief, replacing the incumbent, Hu Chunhua. Guangdong, which borders the former British colony of Hong Kong, is one of China s most economically important provinces. Xinhua did not say what position Hu would assume, but sources with ties to the leadership said he is likely to be promoted to become one of China s vice premiers. Hu, who spent a large part of his career working in restive Tibet, had been considered a candidate for the Standing Committee, the seven-man party body that is China s elite ruling body headed by Xi, but failed to make it on. Three sources with leadership ties told Reuters that Jiangsu party boss Li Qiang is tipped to replace Han Zheng as Shanghai party secretary.  Li is (one of) Xi Jinping s men,  one source said. Li, 58, a native of the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang, was secretary general of the provincial party committee under Xi when the latter was Zhejiang party boss from 2002 to 2007. Li will be a strong contender to be further promoted to the Standing Committee at the next congress in 2022, another source said.  He was appointed to the 25-member Politburo, which is under the Standing Committee, on Wednesday. Former Shanghai leader Han, 63, is likely to become executive or first ranked vice premier next March at the annual meeting of parliament, the sources said.  The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party s spokesman s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1

 WATCH: Expert Says Republicans Blocked NC Black Voters With ‘Surgical Precision’ (VIDEO),"Voting rights expert, Ari Berman, sat down with Joy Reid during Saturday s broadcast of The Reid Report where he and Reid discussed a court ruling that found that the GOP worked to prevent black voters from voting in North Carolina.The segment begins with a reading of part of the Fourth Circuit Court s decision, which reads: The only clear factor linking these various  reforms  is their impact on African American voters. The record thus makes obvious that the  problem  the majority in the general assembly sought to remedy was emerging support for the minority party. This decision in North Carolina was the biggest victory for voting rights since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act because the fourth circuit court was so clear about what happened. North Carolina, as you mentioned, passed the country s strongest and most sweeping voting restrictions,  Berman assesses. They did so just a month after the Supreme Court gutting the Voting Rights Act, Berman continued. John Roberts said it was a thing of the past. What the Fourth Circuit said all of these things they did were meant to target black voters, with  almost surgical precision. The Republican Party have tried to position themselves as the champions of free and fair elections since the Voting Rights Act was struck down. In reality, the reforms that they have put in place have been nothing except an attempt to disenfranchise minority voters.The left has fought against these reforms since they began cropping up. Now, with this landmark decision, the left has much more more legislative muscle to fight back against these racist laws.You can watch the segment below, in full.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"July 30, 2016",0

It hasn t taken the American public long to figure out that the mayor of San Juan is not only  nasty , but ungrateful and apparently, someone who just can t get enough attention. Does she really believe that constantly criticizing the President of the United States is going to help the people who are relying on her to speed up or improve the aid they re getting?

U.S. rebuffs Koch-controlled coal company's bid for royalties,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration has rejected a plea by billionaire investor William Koch to refund as much as $14 million in royalties on a now-shut Colorado mine, according to a letter explaining the decision. The Interior Department last week ruled that Oxbow Mining, a subsidiary of Koch-controlled Oxbow Carbon LLC, is not entitled to a ‘royalty rate reduction’ since the move would do nothing to return the mine to life. Reducing royalty rates has been a tool used by the federal government for decades when maximizing coal production was part of a national energy policy. Oxbow closed its Elk Creek site in western Colorado two years ago after setbacks such as a fire and partial collapse made working the underground mine too costly, according to the company and regulatory paperwork. Oxbow has said it has no plans to reopen the facility, which once employed more than 200 people. Machinery is being sold for scrap and the mine is ready to be sealed, according to regulatory paperwork. “These circumstances indicate that a royalty rate reduction will not expand recovery or promote further development of the leases,” the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management wrote last week in a letter made public on Monday. ‘Royalty rate reduction’ and other such programs meant to promote coal production on public lands are now under scrutiny since President Barack Obama has vowed to curb the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming. William Koch was an heir to the Fred C. Koch family fortune, and two of his brothers, Charles and David, are leading figures in conservative politics. While William Koch is not as politically prominent as his brothers, he has been a significant political donor to conservative causes in the past. A spokesman for Koch and Oxbow did not immediately respond to a call for comment. Rocky Mountain coal has been valued at $35 a ton or more in the last several years, according to a Reuters review of Energy Information Administration data. Because the BLM recommends a royalty rate reduction on 13.1 million tons of coal, the decision positions Oxbow to receive at least a $14 million refund on fuel mined since 2012, according to a Reuters calculation.",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1

 Trump Supporter: There Will Be Civil War Whether Trump Wins Or Not,"It s getting to the point that as frightening as the premise is of a Donald Trump presidency is, the movement he has created has a life of its own and it s beyond frightening. Many are armed, dangerous and itching for a Civil War, no matter how the election turns out.One such supporter attended a rally of Trump s running mate, Mike Pence, on Tuesday in Albuquerque, N.M. The woman, who is identified only as Brenda, really, really wants Trump to win and if he doesn t, she says there will be Second Amendment remedies. There will also be Second Amendment remedies if Trump doesn t win, because apparently Obama will declare martial law. If Hillary Clinton wins the election   and she s on that Second Amendment, taking your guns away, there is going to be a civil war in this state  or elsewhere in the country, the woman who identified herself as Brenda predicted, to some applause in Albuquerque, N.M. But, if President Trump would win,  the woman continued, to hollers from the crowd,  there s also going to be a war, because Obama is going to pull that martial law on the United States. Source: The HillPence tried to reassure Brenda that Clinton won t win, but he did nothing to tamp down the threat of violence, and why would he? That would be off message. Trump might not be overtly calling for violence, but when he suggests that  Second Amendment people  can  do something  about Hillary Clinton, well, all it takes is one wrong person to read into that message.Trump s other message is more subtle, but possibly even more dangerous. At this point, Trump pretty much knows he s about to lose the election and he s setting himself up with a basket of excuses   none of which blame him or his campaign. Trump s portrayal of all his detractors, including Clinton voters, is that they are cheating. He told a crowd in Pennsylvania that the only way he could lose there is if there s cheating. Trump is currently losing Pennsylvania by seven points.Facts don t matter to Trump voters. They are convinced that Trump is some sort of messiah and that if people don t get that, they deserve to be punished. If the nation doesn t vote for Trump, you can guarantee that at least some of his armed followers will cry foul. Whether Trump wins or loses, it won t be pretty.Featured image via Spencer Platt at Getty Images.",News,"August 17, 2016",0
Trump keeps politics on his Thanksgiving menu,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spent the Thanksgiving holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday, dining with his family at the Florida golf club after revisiting a campaign pledge he made about restoring American manufacturing. Trump, known for his use of Twitter to drive political debate, tweeted about an Indiana air conditioner maker he featured in his election campaign as an emblem of trade deals he said were unfavorable to American workers. Trump, who has not been seen in public since arriving in Florida on Tuesday, said he was “working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!” Carrier Corp, a division of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), responded on Twitter that the company has had “discussions with the incoming administration” but had “nothing to announce at this time.” A representative for the company had no additional comment. Earlier this year, the company said it would move 1,400 jobs to Mexico from Indiana, giving a three-year timetable for the shift. The state’s Republican governor, Mike Pence - later picked by Trump as his vice-presidential running mate - decried the decision, and spoke out against it often on the campaign trail. Trump made Carrier’s decision part of his rallying cry against the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. He said he would slap taxes on the company’s air conditioners shipped back to the United States. Asked by Reuters last week whether the company was reconsidering its decision given Trump’s victory in the Nov. 8 election over Democrat Hillary Clinton, the company said in a statement it was “making every effort” to help its Indiana employees during the shift. “By providing three years advance notice of the move and by funding education and retraining programs for up to four years after the move is complete, we are providing employees with both time and opportunity to help them to make a smooth transition,” the company said. Carrier also cited an agreement it had reached with the United Steelworkers union about compensation for affected workers. Trump’s Thanksgiving comments on Carrier were reminiscent of remarks he tweeted last week about Ford Motor Co (F.N), a company he criticized during the campaign for shifting some production lines to Mexico. When Ford informed Trump it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky, he took to Twitter to say he saved the plant, although the company had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky,” Trump tweeted, referring to Ford’s executive chairman. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has been interviewing candidates for his Cabinet and other top White House positions. He and Pence have held more than 60 such meetings since the election. He did not announce any new decisions on Thursday. A spokeswoman said he was spending the evening with family members. “They recognize how precious this kind of time is, and look forward to an evening together to celebrate and count their many blessings,” the spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said. They dined in the Mar-a-Lago club, where the menu included a choice of four chilled seafoods, “Mr. Trump’s Wedge Salad,” devilled eggs, traditional turkey and stuffing, lamb, beef and sea bass. Among the eight desserts: “Three Layer Trump Chocolate Cake.” Trump announced two picks on Wednesday for his Cabinet - South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and wealthy Republican donor and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department. Both are subject to Senate confirmation. Major choices for the Pentagon, State Department and Treasury are still to come. Trump’s State Department deliberations have spurred debate within his inner circle - particularly his consideration of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and businessman who ran against Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election. Romney would be a comforting pick for establishment Republicans. But hardline Trump backers believe he should be disqualified because he called Trump a “fraud” during the Republican nominating race and urged Republicans to stop him from becoming their candidate for the 2016 election. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s senior adviser, said on Thursday she was on the receiving end of a “deluge of social media & private comms” about the Romney option, noting being “loyal” was a positive attribute for the job. Trump and Pence were “spending significant time” on the secretary of state pick, spokesman Jason Miller told reporters before the Thanksgiving break. “They’ll be looking for things like chemistry, experience, a similar vision into what the president-elect and vice president elect are trying to do with this administration,” Miller said.

Trump won't wait to act on trade pact vows: spokesman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump will not wait for Congress to confirm his Cabinet  positions to act on his vows to withdraw from the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a spokesman for the president-elect said on Thursday. Trump, who takes office as president on Friday, declared in November he would give notice of U.S. intent to withdraw from the TPP on “day one” of his presidency, terming it “a potential disaster for our country.” Spicer told reporters Trump had said the moves would be made via executive order. “So I think you will see those happen very shortly,” Spicer added. “I don’t think he’s going to wait. He’s made it very clear that some of those things are huge priorities for him.” Trump’s nominee to run the Treasury Department, Steven Mnuchin, said on Thursday that Washington can renegotiate NAFTA, which was signed by the United States, Canada and Mexico in 1994, in a way that benefits both the United States and Mexico. “I think most people acknowledge NAFTA was negotiated a long time ago, that we should reopen this agreement,” Mnuchin told U.S. senators in his confirmation hearing. “I’m optimistic that we can renegotiate that deal (in a way) that’s both advantageous to us and advantageous to Mexico. That it’s a win-win for both countries.”  An adviser to the Trump transition told Reuters last week that Trump would not revive TPP, which has yet to be ratified by the United States, but would quickly pursue bilateral trade agreements. The TPP has been the main economic pillar of the Obama administration’s “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific region in the face of a fast-rising China.  Proponents of the pact have expressed concerns that abandoning the project, which took years to negotiate, could further strengthen China’s economic hand in the region at the expense of the United States. The trade minister of New Zealand, Todd McClay, said this week that it would be “interesting” to see whether momentum builds around the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), an Asian trade pact that includes China and India, if the United States pulls out of the TPP.

 Trump Threatens America With Riots If He Doesn’t Win The GOP Nomination (VIDEO),"On Wednesday morning, Republican front runner Donald Trump basically said that if another candidate wins the nomination, America could count on riots from his crazed, emotionally unstable supporters.Trump made these comments to Chris Cuomo on CNN s  New Day  after Cuomo asked him if how he would be able to bring the GOP together at the Republican national convention in July, despite the fact that some do not want to see Trump as the nominee at all. The business mogul said: I think there s a natural healing process. Once the battle is over, once the war is over, I think there really is a natural healing process. I ve gotten along with people all my life. This is actually a little bit unusual. I ve gotten along very well with people, and I think it ll happen again. However, because Trump bullies his way into everything, he didn t stop there   he reminded America that his fans have proved that they are absolutely insane with the violence at this rallies, and they won t hesitate take it up a notch if he doesn t win. Tump warned: I think we ll win before getting to the convention. But I can tell you, if we didn t, and if we re 20 votes short or if we re 100 short, and we re at 1100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400   because we re way ahead of everybody   I don t think you can say that we don t get it automatically. I think you d have riots. I think you d have riots. I m representing a tremendous   many, many millions of people. Considering the fact that Trump has encouraged violence several times and even offered to pay any legal fees resulting from his supporters  attacks, there s no reason for us to take this lightly. Trump and his minions have given us more than enough proof that they re dangerous people.Trump then tried to comfort Americans, arguing that everything would go smoothly if we just surrendered all of our dignity and let him win. He said, I wouldn t lead it, but I think bad things would happen. After we win, I think a lot of feelings will be soothed.

"Food security in Middle East, North Africa deteriorating, says U.N. agency","CAIRO (Reuters) - Food security in the Middle East and North Africa is quickly deteriorating because of conflict in several countries in the region, the United Nations said on Thursday.  In those hardest hit by crises   Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Sudan   an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished, the U.N. s Food and Agriculture Organization said in its annual report on food security. A quarter of Yemen s people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times. The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000. It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. But it had worsened in conflict-hit countries.  The costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition,  the FAO s assistant director-general Abdessalam Ould Ahmed said.  Decisive steps towards peace and stability (need to be) taken.  Several countries in the region erupted into conflict following uprisings in 2011 that overthrew leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Syria s civil war, which also began with popular demonstrations, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made more than 11 million homeless. ",worldnews,"December 21, 2017 ",1
"Trump's budget cuts to domestic, aid programs draw Republican scorn","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s first budget outline, calling for a security-heavy realignment of federal spending, drew resistance on Thursday from his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Congress as many balked at proposed deep cuts to diplomatic and foreign aid programs. Conservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10 percent increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. It also takes steps to downsize government, a central goal of conservatives. But the gaze into Trump’s priorities for the next four years proved too savage for many Republicans’ taste, foreshadowing an intense battle between Congress and the White House over spending in coming months. Although Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents’ budget plans. The administration asked Congress for a 28 percent, or $10.9 billion, cut in State Department funding and other international programs to help pay for a 10 percent, $54 billion hike in military spending next year. “These increases in defense come at the expense of national security,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not hesitated to take on Trump. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, leveled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters’ questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process. The budget also drew criticism internationally. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability. The White House shrugged off concerns about the impact, saying Trump was making good on election promises. “The president said, specifically, hundreds of times - you covered him - ‘I’m going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home’ and that’s exactly what we’re doing with this budget,” Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters. Democrats, whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim Republican hold on the Senate, attacked the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and programs that benefit the poor. The White House proposal would inflict a 31 percent, or $2.6 billion, cut on the EPA. Some veteran Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a White House budget chief during the administration of President George W. Bush, vowed to preserve the EPA’s Great Lakes restoration program that Trump wants to eliminate. Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs. Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills, provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of Alaska. “We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt,” Murkowski said. In fact, those “discretionary” programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, account for about $1.2 trillion out of a $3.9 trillion federal budget. The biggest portion of the budget - about $2.4 trillion - is for “mandatory entitlement” programs that provide Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare and Medicaid healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled. Conservatives have been clamoring for years for reforms to those programs to save money. Trump vowed, however, to protect them as he campaigned for president last year. Trump was silent on those programs in the plan released on Thursday, but they will be included in a fuller fiscal blueprint due out in mid-May that will project spending and revenues over 10 years. It is unclear if any reforms for those programs will be part of that budget. Other discretionary cuts proposed by Trump included community development grants at the Housing Department and more than 20 Education Department programs. Funding would disappear for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs. “Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America’s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of that request seen by Reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems. About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N). Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign. Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies.  The budget outline also does not incorporate Trump’s plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come. The planned defense increases are mainly matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit. Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their “core functions” would be preserved.  Reflecting Trump’s repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said. The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the upcoming full budget. Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the  wall. Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States. ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2017 ",1

"China closes more than 13,000 websites in past three years","BEIJING (Reuters) - China has closed more than 13,000 websites since the beginning of 2015 for breaking the law or other rules and the vast majority of people support government efforts to clean up cyberspace, state news agency Xinhua said on Sunday. The government has stepped up already tight controls over the internet since President Xi Jinping took power five years ago, in what critics say is an effort to restrict freedom of speech and prevent criticism of the ruling Communist Party. The government says all countries regulate the internet, and its rules are aimed at ensuring national security and social stability and preventing the spread of pornography and violent content. A report to the on-going session of the standing committee of China s largely rubber stamp parliament said the authorities had targeted pornography and violence in their sweeps of websites, blogs and social media accounts, Xinhua said. As well as the 13,000 websites shut down, almost 10 million accounts had also been closed by websites, it added. It did not give details but the accounts were likely on social media platforms.  Internet security concerns the party s long-term hold on power, the country s long-term peace and stability, socio-economic development and the people s personal interests,  Xinhua said. More than 90 percent of people surveyed supported government efforts to manage the internet, with 63.5 percent of them believing that in recent years there has been an obvious reduction in harmful online content, it added.  These moves have a powerful deterrent effect,  Wang Shengjun, vice chairman of parliament s standing committee, told legislators, according to Xinhua. Authorities including the Cyberspace Administration of China have summoned more than 2,200 websites operators for talks during the same period, he said. Separately, Xinhua said that over the past five years, more than 10 million people who refused to register using their real names had internet or other telecoms accounts suspended. China ushered in a tough cyber security law in June, following years of fierce debate around the controversial legislation that many foreign business groups fear will hit their ability to operate in the country. China maintains a strict censorship regime, banning access to many foreign news outlets, search engines and social media including Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O).

"Papua New Guinea starts dismantling detention camp, threatens forcible evict of asylum seekers","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea began dismantling a shuttered Australian-run immigration detention center on Thursday and warned it will use force if necessary to evict nearly 600 men if they refuse to leave within two days, according to a notice posted at the camp. The asylum seekers have barricaded themselves inside the  Manus island center for the past nine days, defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea to close the camp in a standoff the United Nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis . The men fear violent reprisals from the Manus island community if they move from the camp to three transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the United States. The camp was closed on Oct. 31 and water and power have been cut off.  You may become very sick under these conditions of overflowing sewerage, heaps of rubbish, no clean running water, no electricity and no food,  Papua New Guinea s Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority said in a two-page notice reviewed by Reuters.  You are therefore instructed to vacate this compound immediately...if necessary, force may be used to relocate those who refuse to move voluntarily for your own sake.  The men inside the camp, who include asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Syria, said they will continue to defy attempts to shut the camp. They said they had exhausted their food supplies and were relying on rainwater to drink. Several of the men told Reuters that nearly 100 of them had fallen sick. The notice added that demolition of fences would begin on Thursday. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who has been detained on Manus island for more than four years, said on Twitter that workers had begun that task.  The refugees are watching them fearfully...(they) are extremely scared by immigration threat but still saying we will not leave this prison camp for another prison camp,  he said.  Using force against ppl who ve been suffering nearly 5yrs is no solution. If you re going to solve this problem send us to safe third country.  Australia has used the Manus island center, and another on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. It says boat arrivals will never enter Australia, even if they are found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in Asia. Papua New Guinea s High Court ruled last year that the Manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal and the camp closed on Oct. 31, when Australian-funded security staff withdrew. Thursday s PNG government notice said the camp will soon revert to the control of the nation s military and anyone there unlawfully will be liable for arrest. Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O Neill on Wednesday said  appropriate means  would be used to apprehend those responsible for  disruption . Australia s Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Thursday that the situation was  unacceptable...but the government won t be backing down . The PNG Supreme Court rejected an application by one of the men to restore services on Tuesday, despite pleas from the United Nations to make food, water, medical supplies and power available. Lawyers for the asylum seekers are due to lodge an appeal against later on Thursday. ",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",1

It s a way for people to both grieve and celebrate the life of such an immense talent that was a gift to everyone he came in contact with, whether personally, or through his music.Yet, digging through the very large amount of music that Prince was a part of, it turns out that in the 90s Prince wrote a song called  Donald Trump (Black Version)  put out by the group  The Time.  Upon listening to the lyrics, it seems it s a song that has a man trying to be everything to a woman by buying her affection.Here s a brief taste of the lyrics: Honey baby, you truly know it. You truly know it. You look good. Tryin  your best to show it. If I were you, I would. True love and affection. These are nice, so nice but when a money man walks in the room, girl, you look more than twice. You look once, you look twice.

Highlights: The Trump presidency on January 27 at 6:11 P.M. EST/2311 GMT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday: Trump, scheduled to speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, says he is in the early stages of considering whether to lift U.S. sanctions on Russia, but British Prime Minister Theresa May, other foreign officials and U.S. lawmakers say such a move would be premature. The United States’ and Mexico’s leaders speak by phone after relations between the two countries frayed further over Trump’s border wall plan, with the U.S. president calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties. Nikki Haley, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, pledges to overhaul the world body and warns U.S. allies that if they do not support Washington, then she is “taking names” and will respond. Trump signs an executive order he says will impose tighter vetting to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States. Trump says Syrian Christians will be given priority when it comes to applying for refugee status in the United States. Trump’s executive order taking away federal funding from “sanctuary cities” has an exemption for one of his favorite constituencies, the police, who would be protected from cuts. Opponents say that could be grounds for a legal challenge. Vice President Mike Pence fires up tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists in Washington for the 44th March for Life, celebrating a political shift in their favor with Trump’s election. Pence reportedly tells Republicans a “full evaluation of voting rules” will likely be part of the Trump administration’s investigation into what the president claims is widespread voting fraud. Defense Secretary James Mattis orders cost-cutting reviews of two major aircraft programs, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet and Boeing’s next-generation Air Force One presidential plane, according to Pentagon memos. Trump’s Cabinet is worth a combined $14 billion, and they have been catching flak in recent weeks for confessing an inability to keep track of their vast wealth.

Representative Conyers' future plans to be discussed in 'next day or so': attorney,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The question of whether U.S. Representative John Conyers may resign in the face of sexual harassment allegations will be addressed in the “next day or so,” an attorney for the congressman said on Friday. “We will make another announcement in the coming days as to whether the congressman will continue or whether he will step aside, but that decision is not being made today,” attorney Arnold Reed told reporters outside Conyers’ home as he discussed the allegations. Conyers, who is facing an investigation by the House Ethics Committee, is one of numerous prominent men in U.S. politics, media and entertainment who have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct. Others include former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein, Democratic Senator Al Franken and Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. Conyers has acknowledged settling with one former staffer over her claims of harassment, but he has denied wrongdoing. He has relinquished his post as the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and has said he will cooperate with the ethics probe. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in the House of Representatives, and her top deputies on Thursday had called on Conyers to step aside. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top-ranking Republican in Congress, also said Conyers should resign. Reed said he had spoken with Conyers about his future before the congressman went into the hospital on Wednesday after experiencing dizziness, shortness of breath and lightheadedness, but that Conyers had not reached a definitive decision. “No decision has been made at this juncture,” Reed said. “As you know, his health is not the best,” he said. “We will meet in the next couple days, if he gets stronger, which I anticipate he will, so that we can discuss these issues.” ",politicsNews,"December 1, 2017 ",1
Stop-gap bill to avoid government shutdown fails Senate procedural vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A stop-gap funding bill to avoid a federal government shutdown later this week failed to garner enough votes to move forward in the Senate on Tuesday, with Democrats and Republicans both opposing the measure. The must-pass continuing resolution, or CR, which would keep federal agencies operating from Saturday through Dec. 9, received only 45 of the 60 votes needed to limit debate and be considered for passage by the 100-seat Republican-controlled Senate.  Forty Democrats and two independents opposed the CR because it lacked a $220 million aid package to address the drinking-water crisis in Flint, Michigan. It also drew opposition from 13 Republicans, including Senator Ted Cruz, the former presidential candidate. Senate leaders said they would explore alternatives to avoid a shutdown.   Without an extension, many federal agencies will run out of operating funds when the government fiscal year expires at midnight on Friday. The bill includes $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus and $500 million for flood relief in Louisiana and other states. “This is a 10-week funding bill. Its contents command broad support. It contains zero controversial riders,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said before the vote. Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives vowed to oppose the resolution until Republicans agree to a Flint aid package that the Senate passed by a 95-3 margin this month as part of a separate water resources bill. Flint, a city with over 100,000 people, has had lead-tainted drinking water for more than two years.  Democrats, who say it is unfair to aid flood-ravaged areas and not Flint, want Republicans to include Flint aid in the CR or a version of the water resources bill that the House will vote on this week. Republicans say they will consider Flint later. Both sides say the aid package is paid for. “There is no excuse - none - for not including this provision,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat. McConnell told reporters he would consider the possibility of removing the flood-relief provision from the CR to win support from Democrats. “Let’s see him do it,” Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said when asked about McConnell’s remarks. Reasons for Republican opposition ranged from disapproval of Zika funding in the measure to frustration over the absence of provisions to boost the U.S. Export-Import Bank and block international oversight of the internet.

U.S. consumer financial watchdog official defies Trump from within agency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two days after a federal court endorsed President Donald Trump’s deregulatory pick for a consumer watchdog, a rival official was encouraging agency staff to keep up the pressure on the lending industry, several current and former officials said on Friday. Leandra English, the deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is suing Trump for the right to lead the agency. She wants the bureau to follow through on “several enforcement actions in the pipeline” targeting companies that violate fair lending rules, these people said. Trump has said the agency “devastated” lenders, and his administration is eager to lessen the power of the agency, which was conceived to halt abusive loans. A judge on Tuesday rejected English’s argument to lead the agency, but an appeal is expected. Meanwhile, she is urging colleagues to continue policing the lending industry, said several current and former agency officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. In an email to CFPB managers Thursday evening, English reminded them of the pending enforcement actions and said other routine reports on consumer protections are due in December.  English wrote colleagues that she wants “to be sure that these are still on track,” according to the email seen by Reuters.  She signed the email, “Leandra English, Acting Director.” English has been active at the agency this week, said her lawyer. “She is doing the work of the bureau and looking out for its mission,” said attorney Deepak Gupta. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, has been endorsed by a federal court to lead the CFPB and he has instructed agency staff to “disregard” instructions from English. And he is increasing his influence at the agency. A spokesman for Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, confirmed Friday that Brian Johnson, one of his top aides, had left the committee to assist Mulvaney at the CFPB. Hensarling, a Texas Republican, is one of the CFPB’s harshest critics in Congress. The CFPB’s last director, Richard Cordray, tapped English as his successor when he stepped down last week, a move that sparked the legal wrangling. Cordray left behind 14 lawsuits that are ready to be filed against financial services companies, Mulvaney told the Washington Times on Thursday. Mulvaney told the newspaper he is “combing through” those draft lawsuits now. A spokesman for Mulvaney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. One of the drafted lawsuits is against Santander bank and accuses the Spanish lender of overcharging borrowers on auto loans in the United States, Reuters has reported. Consumer advocates and banking industry leaders have battled over the CFPB for years but both sides agree the president has the right to nominate Cordray’s full-time successor, who must be confirmed by the Senate. Both sides also agree that English is the agency’s deputy director for the time being. The legal fight should last for weeks. ",politicsNews,"December 1, 2017 ",1

They changed their standards for releasing information with Hillary, and Warren wants to know why that same standard can t be used on Wall Street executives. Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton s email server was of sufficient  interest  to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. She s more than right; if Hillary s emails are of sufficient interest to release as much information as possible, then why isn t the information on those who have been proven to cause harm to millions of Americans by crashing the economy of the same interest? It should actually be of bigger interest than the witch hunt against Hillary.The FBI initially released information in response to several FOIA requests from the press, and sent more material to Congress. However, they didn t send over every last, little, tiny bit. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), incensed that they d spurn him like that, subpoenaed the full file earlier this week.Republicans all over Congress are pitching a hell of a tantrum over the FBI not releasing every last scrap of paper, but they really couldn t care less that the FBI didn t release anything after the Department of Justice decided not to prosecute eleven bankers that had a hand in destroying the economy. Why?Simple. When it s Hillary Clinton, everything has to be changed. She must be guilty of something; Republicans and Hillary-haters know things. When it s people who actually harmed America, though? Meh. Not that important why nobody was prosecuted. Here s hoping that Warren s letter has an impact on Comey, because we deserve to know exactly why bankers weren t prosecuted.Featured image by Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",0
Eastern Congo rebels aim to march on Kinshasa: spokesman,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A rebel spokesman in eastern Congo said on Friday that his movement intended to march across the country to the capital Kinshasa to depose President Joseph Kabila, who refused to quit power at the end of his mandate last year. Led by self-proclaimed  general  William Yakutumba, the rebel force, calling itself the National People s Coalition for the Sovereignty of Congo (CNPSC), has emerged as one of the strongest groups in Democratic Republic of Congo s lawless eastern borderlands since its formation in June. Analysts doubt that the CNPSC has the capacity to make a move on the capital. However it briefly captured some strategic towns in June and advanced this week to within a few kilometers of the city of Uvira along Lake Tanganyika, forcing U.N. helicopters to intervene to help Congolese troops drive them back. Congo has been beset by a wave of prison breaks, rebellions and lawlessness since Kabila s refusal to step down in December.   We are even going to reach Kinshasa,  Dalton Waubwela  Mwila, secretary-general of the CNPSC, told Reuters in a telephone interview.  Our ultimate objective is to be in Kinshasa.   Kabila s father, Laurent, came to power in 1997 on the back of a rebellion that started in eastern Congo, marching the more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) to the capital, but he crucially received backing from the armies of neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda.     Waubwela said that the CNPSC includes a number of armed groups in eastern Congo, including in its home province of South Kivu and the neighbouring provinces of North Kivu, Tanganyika and Maniema, where heavy fighting was also reported this week.  Yakutumba formed a militia bearing his name in 2007 and established himself as a warlord, gold smuggler and arms trafficker in South Kivu s Fizi territory, but looks to be trying to raise an insurrection with nationwide support.     Regional wars in eastern Congo, which holds vast reserves of gold, tin, coltan and other minerals, between 1996-2003 killed millions and spawned dozens of armed groups that continue to exploit natural resources and prey on local populations.    Waubwela claimed that the coalition includes more than 10,000 men, but analysts estimate the size of the militia at closer to 300-450, and say it would require significant foreign backing or fresh alliances to be able to occupy much territory, let alone threaten Kabila in Kinshasa.  Waubwela said the rebels have armed themselves with weapons captured from Congolese forces. Speaking to reporters in the eastern city of Goma on Thursday, the army s top general, Didier Etumba, dismissed the CNPSC as a  flash in the pan  that the army would  put out .  But the rebellion is yet another security headache for Kabila, who is also trying to tame a brutal insurgency in central Congo s Kasai region, which has killed up to 5,000 people and displaced 1.4 million more in the past year.

"Obama, Southeast Asia leaders eye China and trade at California summit","RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama gathered with leaders from Southeast Asia on Monday to strengthen trade ties and form a common stance over the South China Sea in a summit that the White House hopes will solidify U.S. influence in the region. Obama, who leaves office next year, has championed a  foreign policy pivot to Asia during his presidency and is determined to present the United States as a Pacific power. His meeting with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was aimed at cementing that legacy. “This reflects my personal commitment, and the national commitment of the United States, to a strong and enduring partnership with your 10 nations,” he said at the start of the two-day summit at Sunnylands, a California resort. The meeting, at the same location where Obama once hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping, was designed to demonstrate Washington’s role as a counterweight to Beijing and as an eager trading partner with ASEAN members. White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice told reporters U.S. companies had more than doubled investment in the region since 2008. On Monday the leaders were slated to focus on economic issues, including discussion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which includes four ASEAN members: Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia. Others are interested in joining, and the White House wants to make sure the pact takes effect. On Tuesday, the leaders will discuss maritime issues, particularly the South China Sea, where China and several Southeast Asian states have conflicting and overlapping claims. White House officials have said Obama would deliver a tough message to China that disputes over the South China Sea must be resolved peacefully and not by bullying. “Here at this summit, we can advance our shared vision of a regional order where international rules and norms, including freedom of navigation, are upheld and where disputes are resolved through peaceful, legal means,” Obama said. The challenge may be to get all ASEAN countries to agree on a strong statement on the issue. Officials say China has put pressure on countries such as Cambodia and Laos not to sign. “I’m ... confident that our shared commitment to upholding these norms will be reinforced,” Rice said. China’s role in the region hung over the meeting. Rice said she expected China would support new international sanctions on North Korea for its recent rocket launches.  An editorial in the influential Chinese tabloid the Global Times on Tuesday said the summit was the wrong place to discuss South China Sea issues and that it would not yield “striking geopolitical decisions”.  “ASEAN countries have no such desire, and the U.S. knows it is not able to do so,” the Global Times said, repeating Beijing’s stance that disputes in the sea should be handled bilaterally. Advocacy group Human Rights Watch urged the Obama administration to object to human rights violations in countries such as Cambodia and Thailand during the summit. The president touched on the issue without specifics during his remarks. “Here at the summit, we can reaffirm that strong, prosperous and inclusive societies require good governance, rule of law, accountable institutions, vibrant civil societies and upholding human rights,” he said. Combating climate change and cooperating on counter-terrorism and the fight against Islamic State militants were also on the agenda.  Obama returns to Washington on Tuesday.

CONDOLEEZZA RICE BRILLIANTLY Shuts Down “The View” Dingbats Over Trump-Russia Collusion [VIDEO],"On more than one occasion, Condoleezza Rice was able correct the record by pointing out the hypocrisy of these ladies in such a way that they didn t even know it. It started with Trump-hater and ABC senior legal analyst Sunny Hostin asking about General Flynn s alleged discussions with Russia weeks before Trump s inauguration asking,  As someone who has had that position as national security advisor, would you have felt comfortable having those discussions, is that inappropriate?  Rice went on to explain how you will have conversations with foreigners, but the thing you shouldn t do is discuss policy. She then went on to say that,  There s only one president  and that as a matter of principle, you can talk to anybody in that period, but you should never suggest that you might be making changes in policy and maybe they should just wait until there s a change in administration. Was Rice referring to the time Obama was caught on a hot mic telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,  This is my last election, after the election, I ll have more flexibility ?While explaining how we should be handling Vladimir Putin s potential meddling in our elections, Rice reminded the panel that when Hillary was Secretary of State she questioned the legitimacy of Putin s election in 2012 and now he s saying,  I m going to question the legitimacy of your election . Rice s answer wasn t quite what The View hacks had hoped for, and like a dog on a bone, The View host Sunny Hostin continued,  But Madame Secretary, if he [Putin] indeed did engage in these kinds of tactics in the election, then the very legitimacy of our election is at issue isn t it? Rice snapped back,  No. Rice then went on to say,  I trust the people who voted in Wisconsin and Texas and Alabama and California to have voted on the basis of who they thought was best gonna represent their interests. So I m not gonna question the legitimacy of their vote because Vladimir Putin tried to interfere in the elections. That s just a step that I m don t think we should take. Let s trust our fellow citizens to have been smart enough to vote for the people they ought to be voting for.  ZING! WATCH:And for the final blow, fake conservative host Jedidiah Bilah  (who, let s face it, is really just collecting a paycheck because she s a token  conservative  who s too weak to stand up for anything) has the opportunity to defend conservatism in some way with one of the most brilliant female conservatives sitting on their panel and she used the opportunity to trash President Trump over his handling of N.

 Rachel Maddow Obtains Document That Means VERY BAD News For Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Ever since the courts blocked Donald Trump s ridiculous Muslim ban, the White House has been saying that they will fight it all the way, that the ban would be back in short order. However, the Trump Administration keeps putting it off. Now, it seems that the ban may not happen at all.The Rachel Maddow Show has obtained a document from the Department of Homeland Security that essentially says that the travel ban based upon nationality has absolutely nothing to do with protecting the nation from terrorist attacks. In fact, the new document says that most extremists are brainwashed into their ideology right here on American soil. They generally tend to be citizens and legal residents. So, in other words, there is absolutely no reason to ban people based upon nationality. Couple that with the fact that Trump and those in his orbit are openly anti-Muslim, and one can only conclude that this  travel ban  is nothing but an attempt to make Trump s call to keep Muslims out of the country pass constitutional muster.Even more damning is the fact that the chaos caused by the clumsy roll out of Trump s original Executive Order regarding this matter, and we can only come to the conclusion that Trump will again be met with resistance from the courts if he tries to do this again.Watch the report below:Featured image via Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images",News,"March 2, 2017",0
Trump's infrastructure splurge would collide with U.S. skilled labor crunch,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump’s drive to rebuild U.S. roads, bridges, ports and other public works projects with a $1 trillion infrastructure investment plan would come as the country faces a shortage of skilled laborers.   Before any dirt can be moved, Trump would have to get approval from Congress. But with Democratic support and a push from business groups, there is some optimism that Trump could win over skeptical Republicans who control Congress, if the plan does not add significantly to federal debt.   More than two-thirds of U.S. roads are in less than good condition and nearly 143,000 bridges need repair or improvement, the Transportation Department estimates.     At the same time, construction contractors have reported tight labor conditions in the South, Midwest and Southwest, causing project delays, the Federal Reserve noted last month. Earlier this year, the National Association of Home Builders estimated there were around 200,000 unfilled construction jobs in the United States, an 81 percent increase in the last two years.  Infrastructure projects need highly trained workers, such as heavy equipment operators and iron specialists. But as a result of the 2007-2008 recession, which caused an estimated 25 percent of construction jobs to vanish, their ranks have thinned. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2h9paJX) Many of these workers went back to school, joined the military or got lower-paying jobs in retail, services and other sectors. Some just got too old for the rigors of construction. “They wandered off into other careers,” said Leonard Toenjes, president of Associated General Contractors of Missouri, which represents contractors in the state. Undocumented immigrants, who otherwise might help replenish those ranks, are unlikely candidates however, since companies do not want to invest in training people with an uncertain status, especially given Trump’s anti-immigrant bent. The labor shortage is driving up construction costs, according to government and industry experts, which could cut into the scope of any new Washington investment scheme. In response to the construction “skills gap,” the U.S. Department of Labor and Federal Highway Administration are aiming to expand help to localities training workers for road and bridge building, according to a FHWA spokesman. Even if the scope of work is not as grandiose as Trump originally envisioned, it would benefit a range of businesses, from steel maker Nucor Corp and concrete firm US Concrete Inc to construction machinery companies such as Caterpillar Inc. More infrastructure spending would boost trade unions, too, which appeals to Democrats.      “We will build new roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads, airports, schools and hospitals,” Trump boasted in a Dec. 1 speech in Cincinnati. A Trump transition representative, who asked not to be named because the topic was still under discussion, said that enactment of “infrastructure funding legislation” is one of the top priorities for the first 100 days of the new administration. A Trump website refers to taking steps that would fill a $1 trillion gap in infrastructure investments over 10 years. Like many Trump campaign proposals, his infrastructure plan is thin on details. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters earlier this month: “What I hope we will clearly avoid, and I’m confident we will, is a trillion-dollar stimulus.” In a departure from past fiscal policies, Trump has proposed slashing taxes and expanding infrastructure investment at a time of economic stability. Historically, such steps have been used by the government to provide economic stimulus in recessions. Trump has discussed investor tax credits for infrastructure projects. Democrats have attacked this as a boon to Wall Street that would spark too few projects and create too few jobs. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters last week infrastructure is something her party could collaborate on with Republicans. But she said Democrats would reject anything “disguised as infrastructure. It has to be a real infrastructure bill that grows the paychecks of American workers.”     If Congress balks at writing a big check, there is talk of a mix of alternatives. One could involve new corporate income tax revenue from bringing foreign profits into the country. Others could be an infrastructure revolving fund, raising the gasoline tax or a new surface freight fee, experts said. These could help marquee projects move forward: a Hudson River rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey; a deeper port in Charleston, South Carolina; expanded rail service in southern California; fixing the crumbling I-70 freeway in Missouri; replacing a key bridge linking Ohio and Kentucky. Harry Holzer, professor of public policy at Georgetown University, said fixing roads and bridges would boost U.S. productivity and, depending on how it is structured, generate good-paying jobs for those without college educations. Given shortages of high-skilled construction labor, he said government ought to ramp up the projects carefully to allow time to train a new generation of skilled workers. “I’m not sure anyone has thought that through,” he said.

 Trump Won’t Give Sean Spicer The Boot Because ‘That Guy Gets Great Ratings’,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer is a trainwreck. After all, this is the guy who said Hitler really wasn t that bad. Everybody tunes in daily to see what ridiculous assertion will come out of his mouth this time, and apparently, that is all the job security he needs in Donald Trump s administration.According to the Washington Post, Trump has no intention of firing Spicer because he  gets great ratings,  and in Trump s White House, ratings matter far more than facts. The WaPo article explores Trump s obsession with cable news and revealed that Spicer s job is safe as long as he can keep people turning in to watch him crash and burn. I m not firing Sean Spicer,  Trump said, according to sources.  That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in. The Washington Post reports that  most of the televisions in the West Wing display four channels at all times  CNN, Fox, Fox Business and MSNBC.  The article also noted that  during an intimate lunch recently with a key outside ally in a small West Wing dining room, for instance, Trump repeatedly paused the conversation to make the group watch a particularly combative Spicer briefing. Spicer has become a laughing stock. Saturday Night Live has had a blast lampooning him in recent months, with Melissa McCarthy playing the role of the press secretary. The fact that Spicer was portrayed on SNL by a woman seemed to be more upsetting to Trump than any of Spicer s numerous gaffes.The press secretary kicked off his very first press conference by claiming that Trump s inauguration really didn t have a pathetic turnout, despite pictures proving he was full of it. And things have only gone downhill from there. But as long as America keeps tuning in for Spicer s daily dumpster fires press briefings, he can rest assured that Trump is going to keep him around.

Trump's jobs homecoming a long shot even in manufacturing hot spots ,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla (Reuters) - When U.S. manufacturing employment peaked, Jimmy Carter was president, inflation was 11 percent, and craftsmen at Frontier Contact Lenses made the company’s products one at a time on diamond-tipped lathes. As presidential candidates promise to reclaim jobs lost in the intervening decades, they might want to visit the company now. Bought by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in 1981, the fully automated factory allows four workers to produce in a 12-hour shift what more labor-intensive methods produced in a year. The Jacksonville plant and one in Ireland make 4 billion soft contacts a year, and between the robots and lasers and computer algorithms no worker touches the product from the start of the process through final packaging. “I don’t think you could even make 4 billion lenses” using the old method, said David Turner, vice president of research and development for Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. “You’d need a guy with a lathe in every town.” Since peaking at 19.5 million in 1979, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs has fallen 37 percent to around 12.2 million as of March, or just over 10 percent of the private sector workforce. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1WqpioK) That may be as good as it gets. Despite the promises made on the campaign trail by Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and other candidates, the next president will find it hard to raise manufacturing’s share of a U.S. labor force that keeps shifting toward services. While much of the jobs debate has centered on trade pacts  that Democrats and Republicans have backed over the last quarter century, both successful and struggling companies and sectors offer evidence of long-term trends that neither sharp trade negotiators nor aggressive political leaders can easily reverse. Even critics of trade deals acknowledge that labor intensive industries, such as textiles, which once employed hundreds of thousands of less-skilled workers, are probably gone for good. Technology continues to diminish the share of labor in production and its spread around the world has made other nations - notably China, but also Korea, Brazil, Mexico and former Soviet bloc countries - competitive both as exporters and in their own markets. Investment worldwide is drifting steadily toward services, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and Americans are spending relatively less of their income on manufactured goods.     A Reuters analysis of federal data for 1,267 categories of goods shows that the United States has been running a trade deficit in more than 500 of them since at least 1992 - before the North American Free Trade Agreement came into force or China joined the World Trade Organization, events often cited as turning points for U.S. manufacturing. Since the 2007-2009 recession manufacturing has added about 800,000 jobs, but that has lagged overall job growth. As a result manufacturing’s share of private employment has continued to fall, from about 11 percent since the recession ended. “The move toward a more global market hurts the marginal, low-skilled worker, but it was inevitable and you cannot roll it back,” said Brookings Institution senior fellow Barry Bosworth. At CareerSource Northeast Florida, a job development group, President Bruce Ferguson, Jr. said by necessity he focused on finding a “path” for entry level service sector employees to move up a career ladder, because services are where the growth is.   “The raw (manufacturing) numbers don’t look anything like the service sector and they never will,” he said.  A majority of 6,500 Americans surveyed in March as part of Reuters/Ipsos 2016 campaign polling acknowledged that free trade brings lower prices, but also saw it as a drag on wages and jobs and an “important” issue for the next president to confront. Tapping such concerns, Trump has promised punitive tariffs to “bring back” jobs for those left behind in the current recovery, particularly the roughly two thirds of Americans without a college degree.    Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton switched gears as a candidate to oppose a major Pacific trade deal and promises billions in public support for manufacturing. Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders calls for worker protection against what he considers unfair trade, while Republican Ted Cruz has focused on trimming government red tape. However, playing tough on trade carries some risks and there are limits to what trade talks and tariffs can accomplish. The U.S. steel industry is a case in point. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates around 12,000 jobs were lost to a recent jump in imports, mainly from China. It reckons those jobs could be recovered with steps, such as the anti-dumping duties imposed by Washington late last year. That pales, however, in comparison with more than 200,000 jobs that the sector has lost since the early 1980s, some because of imports, but some because the amount of labor needed to produce a ton of steel has fallen from 10 hours to less than two.  “There has been a short term loss that is definitely attributable to imports, while a longer term trend reflects technological innovation,” said Kevin Dempsey, the institute’s senior vice president.  Such dynamic is not limited to old industries like steel. Florida is home to successful manufacturers big and small in a wide range of sectors, which export nearly half of their output - double the national average. Yet, as is the case nationally, the share of jobs available to those with a high school degree has been shrinking since 2000, according to federal data, and wages have been stagnant. Johnson & Johnson Vision Care’s recent approval of a $300 million expansion, which added some 100 jobs, cements the company’s U.S. presence, but also shows how technology and innovation reshape the landscape. The company’s local workforce has risen to around 1,700, but about 60 percent of that are white collar and non-manufacturing jobs - from research positions for PhD scientists to those in sales and a highly automated shipping operation. Florida development officials say the trend is clear: manufacturers keep cutting the labor content of their products and each round of investment tends to drive up the skill levels that workers need. That may benefit the state’s economy, but acts as a reality check for workers who hope that the November 8 presidential vote can reverse decades-old trends. “How do you evaluate a company that says we will spend a lot of money and make the workforce more qualified but not create many jobs?” said Aaron Bowman, senior vice president for business development at JAXUSA Partnership, a regional economic development agency and division of the local chamber of commerce. “Over time you see more projects that bring in fewer jobs but a bigger bang.”     ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
Milestones in legal fight over Texas abortion law,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set to rule on Monday on a legal challenge by abortion providers to a Texas law requiring doctors performing the procedure to have “admitting privileges” at local hospitals and clinics to meet hospital-grade standards.  Following is a timeline of that challenge. July 2013 - The Republican-led Texas legislature passes and Republican Governor Rick Perry signs the law known as H.B. 2, putting new requirements on abortion providers. State officials say the law is intended to ensure the health and safety of women. September 2013 – Before the law is enforced, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers challenge the measure. They assert that certain provisions, including one related to doctors’ “admitting privileges” - a type of formal affiliation - at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of an abortion clinic, are aimed at decreasing the abortion availability in the state. October 2013 – A U.S. district judge sides largely with the challengers, blocking the admitting privileges provision. March 2014 - The New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, a regional federal appeals court covering Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, reverses the lower court and permits much of the law to take effect.  April 2014 - Whole Woman’s Health and other abortion providers bring a new complaint against Texas, citing the effect of the law’s implementation and the number of clinics that have closed. The challengers focus on the admitting-privileges requirement and regulations governing clinic facility standards. August 2014 – A U.S. district court judge declares the admitting privileges and clinic requirements an unconstitutional burden on women’s access to abortion. October 2014 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit intervenes to allow implementation of both new regulations, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocks part of the order so that the mandate that clinics meet hospital-grade standards does not go into effect. June 2015 - After considering the full merits of the challenge, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reverses the district judge’s decision, finding the judge should have deferred to the legislature’s stated health and safety goals. The appeals court also says most of the lawsuit should have been barred because the legal issues it raises already were addressed in the case filed by Planned Parenthood. June 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote puts a temporary hold on the 5th Circuit’s ruling while the justices consider whether to hear the challengers’ appeal. That action blocks the provision regarding hospital-grade standards from taking effect. September 2015 - The abortion providers challenging the Texas restrictions ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeal of the 5th Circuit’s ruling. November 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the challenge by abortion providers to the Texas restrictions. February 2016 - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a supporter of abortion restrictions, dies at age 79, leaving the court shorthanded and evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives. March 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court hears 85 minutes of oral arguments in the case, known as Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. The court’s four liberal justices indicate they believe the law intrudes on a woman’s constitutional right to abortion. The four conservative justices express doubts about claims by abortion providers that the law forced numerous clinics to shut down. June 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court is due to rule on Monday in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. ",politicsNews,"June 26, 2016 ",1

The move gives ad buyers who were already concerned that Fox couldn t control Hannity a new reason for alarm. It gives advertisers who previously abandoned O Reilly s show a reason to fear that their ads elsewhere on the network could end up promoting him. And it gives British regulators   who were already reviewing Fox as part of Rupert Murdoch s $15 billion bid to purchase Sky   a reason to worry about the network s corporate governance and commitment to changing its seedy culture.Fox knows all this, so it seems more likely that the network was blindsided by a host who s out of its control than that it is willingly complicit in his effort to promote his former colleague. And Hannity knows it too. He just doesn t care.This may be the beginning of Fox s nightmare   the last remaining member of its former dream team, openly revolting and daring the network to fire him and let him take his audience somewhere else.

UK Prince Charles's tour of southeast Asia leaves out Myanmar,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s Prince Charles will tour southeast Asia and India later this month, but the heir to the throne will not visit Myanmar, after a spate of violence and allegations that authorities are carrying out ethnic cleansing. Media reports last month said an official visit to Myanmar was being suggested for the trip, which the prince is undertaking on behalf of the British government, and aides acknowledged it had been considered as part of the schedule. But it was omitted from the final program issued on Wednesday. Charles and his wife Camilla will travel to Singapore, Malaysia and then to India where he will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.      We looked at a range of options in the region and, as we re announcing today, we re going ahead with the visit to Singapore and Malaysia,  Philip Malone, Deputy Head of Department at Britain s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, told reporters. Malone and royal aides declined to elaborate. More than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh in the past month since insurgents attacked security posts near the border, triggering fierce military retaliation that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. Last month Britain suspended its training program for the military in Myanmar because of the violence, and diplomatic relations have deteriorated. Rights campaigners had argued against a royal visit.  To have someone of Prince Charles s stature go to visit the country would be seen as a reward, and giving legitimacy to the government and the military that are currently violating international law,  said Mark Farmaner, director of Burma Campaign UK. Charles and Camilla will begin their tour in Singapore on Oct. 31 before going to Malaysia, where they will celebrate 60 years of diplomatic ties since the former British colony became independent, before concluding the 11-day tour in India.

Fear and loathing in South Korea as university exam postponed by quake,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean test-takers expressed confusion and dejection on Thursday as the country s highly competitive annual university entrance exam, called a  life assignment exam  by some, was postponed a week for the first time ever due to safety concerns.  South Korea postponed the exam after a rare earthquake rattled the country on Wednesday, causing damage to buildings including some schools. The exam is life-defining for many high school seniors, as a prestigious university on one s resume is seen a minimum for securing a place in limited corporate jobs in Asia s fourth-largest economy, which is dominated by conglomerates.  Because the wrong answer to a single question in the roughly 200-question exam can mean dropping in the national ranking and failure to enter one s choice of university, tensions ran high.   It s a bit hellish thinking I have to do this for one more week,  said 20-year-old Cho Hyun-lee, studying at one of Seoul s largest cram schools to take the test again after last year.  People are dispirited, lying with their faces down.   Some scrambled to recover books they d thrown away yesterday or buy new ones, two test-takers told Reuters, while others  gave up , uploading pictures of classmates sleeping or reading online comics on social media. Still others agonized over missing concerts of their favorite singers or South Korea s largest online game exhibition this week.  Meanwhile, South Korean society, geared for the exam s smooth progress, prepared to do it all again next Thursday.   Airplanes, barred from taking off or landing for 35 minutes on Thursday morning to prevent their noise from interfering with the exam s listening section, were allowed to land or take off, the transport ministry said.  But the stock market and banks still opened an hour late on Thursday   a device to help keep roads clear for students getting to test sites.  The defense ministry allowed extra leave for soldiers in mandatory military service who had taken personal leave to sit the exam.  Four police officers were stationed on double shifts at each of the 85 locations exam questions are kept and police patrolled the premises every two hours to prevent their leaking.  As fainter aftershocks continued on Wednesday and Thursday, many Koreans said they support the postponement   but some were inconsolable.   It feels like I was turning the handle on the exit door from hell then returned to square one,  said Lee Yoon-mi, a high school senior in Incheon.   If you re not a test-taker, you could never understand.   ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

BREAKING: OBAMA COMMUTES 67 Prisoners Serving Life Sentences…214 Federal Prisoners In Total,"Making America Unsafe Again It s the Obama legacy. During his two terms in office, Obama released more prisoners than all nine Presidents before him combined. He s not just flooding our local communities and major cities with felons, he s flooding America s  red states  with illegal aliens and unvetted Muslim immigrants from countries who hate us, all to ensure Democrat Party dominance. President Barack Obama on Wednesday cut short the sentences of 214 federal inmates, including 67 life sentences, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century.Almost all the prisoners were serving time for nonviolent drug crimes, reflecting Obama s long-stated view that the U.S. needs to remedy the consequences of decades of sentencing requirements that put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Obama has pushed for a broader fix to criminal justice laws and has used the aggressive pace of his commutations in an effort to pressure Congress and call more attention to the issue.All told, Obama has commuted 562 sentences during his presidency   more than the past nine presidents combined, the White House said. Almost 200 of those who have benefited were serving life sentences.  Fox News",left-news,"Aug 3, 2016",0
 Man Claims He Gave Trump A Golden Shower And He Has Evidence To Back It Up (VIDEO),"You know how conservatives are demanding proof that Donald Trump paid some Russian ladies for a golden shower (honestly, wouldn t we all enjoy that)? Well, this gentleman gave The Donald one for free and he can provide evidence.Meet Dino Rachiele. A quick scroll through his Facebook timeline shows that he doesn t post about politics much, if any (though one post reveals that he makes a delicious-looking Timpano), but he is now gaining recognition for a video he made years ago in which he spoke out about the time that he gave a certain billionaire a golden shower. This video was largely ignored until now but with news breaking that Trump allegedly paid a couple of nice Russian ladies to  drain the swamp  on his bed, his YouTube video is picking up traffic quite quickly.Rachiele manufactures high-end sinks (what did you think we meant by  golden shower,  perverts?) and used to sell home fixtures, according to Gizmodo. In his 2011 video,  I gave Donald Trump a golden shower,  Rachiele   who inexplicably found himself able to vote for someone as terrible as Trump   says he sent Donald Trump one of two gold shower heads in 2007 and decided to gift one of them to The Donald during one of his feuds with Rosie O Donnell because he knows, like a couple Russian prostitutes seem to know, that Donald Trump just adores gold.Now, some might consider it unbelievable that Rachiele gave The Donald a golden shower, so here s a letter from Trump s assistant at the time verifying that Rachiele did, indeed, send Trump a golden showerhead, but it also seems to indicate that it was part of a sales pitch. The letter informed Rachiele that Trump  has no interest in purchasing at this time  with a vague promise of possibly working together in the future and a boilerplate  we wish you the greatest success in your endeavors):In what seems to be a clear attempt to create a demand for a  limited edition  product by first sending one to Trump and later deceptively omitting the fact that it was manufactured by a company owned by Rachiele, he then invites people to email him to get what he claims is the only other one in existence for the hefty price tag of $350. Either he was lying about it being the only one or there were no takers, as he now says he is considering taking bids on it.If conservatives are as stupid as I know they are, Rachiele will be getting his own  golden shower  soon enough when one of them spends their kid s college fund on this piece of poorly manufactured history.Watch his video below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 11, 2017",0

Turkey says expects humanitarian aid can be delivered in Syria's Idlib,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Thursday it expected humanitarian aid could be delivered to Syria s northern province of Idlib, which is under the control of a rebel alliance spearheaded by the former al Qaeda offshoot Nusra Front.  Our expectation is that Idlib, just like other de-escalation zones, becomes a region where humanitarian aid can easily be delivered,  presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told a news conference in Ankara.  Turkey will do whatever falls upon it on this matter.  Turkey said last month it was limiting the movement of non-humanitarian aid into Idlib because the area is controlled by a  terrorist organization . ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Davos elite alarmed at prospect of nominee Trump," DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - “Unbelievable”, “embarrassing” even “dangerous” are some of the words the financial elite gathered at the World Economic Forum conference in the Swiss resort of Davos have been using to describe U.S. Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.  Although some said they still expected his campaign to founder before his party picks its nominee for the November election many said it was no longer unthinkable that he could be the Republican candidate.  Some noted that whatever the outcome, a heated campaign, which has also seen self-proclaimed Socialist Bernie Sanders provide a tough challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, could alter the U.S. political environment, giving vent to new populist anger on both sides of the political divide.  Trump's nationalist rhetoric, particularly proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States, tax goods made abroad and build a wall on the Mexican border, were never the sort of thing to appeal to the free trade crowd that typically gathers at events like the annual Davos economic forum.  “Clearly it is not a rhetoric that is inviting for integration,” said Chile’s Finance Minister, Rodrigo Valdes, referring to his comments on the campaign trail.  “In Chile we have a deep view that integration of the Americas is a good thing, whether it is goods, financing and yes people. So I’d be happier with a more welcoming rhetoric.”  Among the present and former government officials in the Swiss resort was Eric Cantor, former Republican majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, now vice-chairman of Moelis & Co, an investment bank. Like much of the Republican party’s establishment, he had cold words for Trump.  “He’s not serious. He’s amazing at promoting his personal brand and reflecting an underlying anger at home,” Cantor said.  “Trump Fever is an unsustainable phenomenon that will not translate into a victory for the candidate.”  But for Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of Skybridge Capital, a $13 billion hedge fund whose founder has supported other Republican candidates including Jeb Bush, such establishment pronouncements sound like wishful thinking.  “Is Donald going to be the nominee? I don’t know. It’s sure looking that way now,” Nolte said. “Anyone here (at Davos) who is in the mainstream says there is no way he could possibly get the nomination. When I hear that, it probably means it is going to happen.”  Noting the challenge to Clinton from Sanders, which he said could pull her to the left on issues like financial regulation, Nolte said institutional investors were already paying attention to the prospect of increased U.S. political volatility from the election.  Arianna Huffington, whose Huffington Post news website once insisted on covering Trump, a former reality TV star, as an entertainment figure rather than a politician, said the site reversed its policy once he announced his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which made him too ""dangerous"" to ignore.   “I feel the mainstreaming of Donald Trump, instead of him being treated as an extreme, dangerous candidate, is really the most troubling aspect of American politics right now,” she said.  “He’s being interviewed on all the main shows, and he’s being asked questions about what his first State of the Union address would be like if he wins, instead of actually being forced to answer the tough questions about his policy, especially his policy of wanting to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., which is so dangerous, so un-American and should really be the center of the coverage of Trump.”  For Dominic Barton, global managing director for business consultancy McKinsey, Trump has turned the political campaign itself into “entertainment”, which could hurt the global image of the United States.  “It’s a bit embarrassing globally. But I think there’s a big difference between the rhetoric and the reality, and I think most people will see that and discount it. But it’s incredible how long its been going for. It’s just unbelievable,” he said.  But not everyone is worried. Sandeep Dadlani, executive vice president of Indian outsourcing firm Infosys, said his firm has earned the majority of its revenue in the United States for more than 30 years.  ""We have seen many elections come and go. It is common in all election seasons for rhetoric and extreme personalities to shine. Inevitably we have found governments from both sides to eventually come up with sensible policies,"" he said.   (Reporting by Martinne Geller, Carmel Crimmins, Noah Barkin and others; Writing by Peter Graff; editing by Anna Willard)",politicsNews,"January 21, 2016 ",1
 AZ Cops Taser Veteran With PTSD Until His Heart Stops Beating (VIDEO),"Cops in America are out of control, and here is yet another case of a police department who needs to be sued into oblivion due to excessive force. Kyle Cardenas of Gilbert, Arizona is a veteran with PTSD who went through two harrowing tours of duty in Iraq. His family says that they contacted the VA Crisis Hotline due to Kyle s having a mental health emergency related to his PTSD. That s when things went wrong.The Gilbert cops showed up, and there was a scuffle. The thing that is really awful here is that the family insisted that they wanted a crisis team   and they also said hammered the point home that they wanted no cops. However, cops   violent cops   are just what they got. They have filed an official complaint, which says, in part: The police charged into this bedroom   and attempted to restrain Kyle again. During the melee, the officers Tased Kyle at least seven times, sprayed OC spray directly into Kyle s face, struck Kyle multiple times with their batons, punched Kyle in the face with closed fists, kicked and kneed Kyle in the thighs and legs, and ordered one of the K-9 unit dogs to attack and bite Kyle. That is beyond despicable, but wait   there s more. When Kyle was immobilized on a hospital gurney, the trigger happy cops used a Taser on him again, this time until his heart stopped beating and medical professionals had to restart it.Of course, despite all of this, the cops are playing the victims here, and they say that they attempted to bring Kyle in without incident, but that he was violent. Well, no sh*t. You were scaring a man who was already suffering from a mental breakdown. This is why police are the last people who should be sent to deal with mental health crises.Thanks to the reckless, violent cops, Kyle Cardenas is now permanently disabled. The Gilbert Police Department says they are  looking into  what happened here, but of course, they ll likely investigate themselves and clear themselves of any and all wrongdoing.Watch a video news report below, via ABC 15:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 29, 2016",0
"Rubio seeks re-election to Senate, says Trump 'worrisome'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will seek re-election to his U.S. Senate seat, he announced on Wednesday, reversing a pledge not to run and saying the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency worries him. The first-term Florida senator said the Senate can be frustrating, but that it is also a place where policy advances can be made and one that can counteract the power of the White House. “But as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation, there’s another role for the Senate that could end up being its most important in the years to come: The Constitutional power to act as a check and balance on the excesses of a president,” Rubio said in a statement. The 45-year-old lawmaker, a proven fund-raiser who is well known nationally, had been under intense pressure to run, especially given the cost of contesting an important election swing-state where campaign advertising is expensive. Republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the Nov. 8 general election, as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the Senate. He could also rally Republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, took Florida by just a one percentage-point margin in 2012 over Republican Mitt Romney. This year, Republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the 100-member Senate, compared with just 10 the Democrats have to fight to retain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it would be a “terrific outcome” if Rubio decided to run.  Rubio had harsh words for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed Obama’s “failed” policies. But he said the prospect of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the White House was also “worrisome,” citing Trump’s statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely Republican nominee’s positions on important issues are unknown. “If he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him,” Rubio’s statement said. Still, he pledged to vote for Trump, a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the Republican establishment.  “It’s not the choice I wanted ... and it’s not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with, but it’s the choice we have,” he told CNN in an interview. His announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country, including the mass shooting. The decision reversed a campaign pledge Rubio made a year ago to retire from the Senate if his presidential bid failed. He ended his bid for the nomination in March after losing the primary in his home state to Trump following a harsh war of words. The Cook Political Report said Rubio’s announcement “breathed new life” into Republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a toss-up, citing his poor Senate attendance record and the senator’s remarks during his presidential campaign that he was “frustrated” with the upper chamber. Republican U.S. Representative David Jolly, who had been seeking the Senate seat, opened the door for Rubio to run when he stepped aside last week.  After Wednesday’s announcement, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera, a friend of Rubio, and Republican U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat. Other Republicans, however, have not announced plans to quit ahead of Florida’s Aug. 30 primary. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a leading Democratic challenger, accused Rubio of first abandoning his constituents, and now “treating them like a consolation prize.” ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1
Trump's lawyer denies collusion with Russia in 2016 election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s lawyer on Tuesday denied that he or Trump colluded with Russia to interfere in last year’s presidential election, and said such charges were meant to discredit Trump’s presidency. “I emphatically state that I had nothing to do with any Russian involvement in our electoral process,” Michael Cohen said in a statement prepared for a scheduled meeting with Senate Intelligence Committee investigators that was ultimately postponed. “Given my own proximity to the president of the United States as a candidate, let me also say that I never saw anything - not a hint of anything - that demonstrated his involvement in Russian interference in our election or any form of Russia collusion,” Cohen said. After the statement was reported by media organizations on Tuesday morning, Cohen and his attorney, Stephen Ryan, traveled to Capitol Hill for a closed-door interview with Intelligence Committee investigators - but were told that the committee had decided to postpone the meeting. The Senate committee, as well as other congressional panels and special counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating Russia’s reported interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump or his top aides colluded with Moscow. Cohen’s name surfaced in a dossier, compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, that reported Cohen played an important role in liaison with the Russian government and secretly met with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016. The Steele dossier, Cohen said in his statement, is “riddled with falsehoods and intentionally salacious allegations.” “I have never in my life been to Prague or to anywhere in the Czech Republic,” he said. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials have said that while they cannot verify all the details in the Steele dossier, neither have they debunked it entirely. It was not immediately clear why Cohen’s meeting with Senate investigators was postponed. “The committee has chosen to postpone today’s interview and we will come back for a voluntary interview whenever we can to meet with them,” Ryan told reporters. “Mr. Cohen will continue to co-operate.” Cohen said in his statement that the collusion charges are meant to discredit Trump’s presidency. “I’m also certain that there are some in this country who do not care about the facts, but simply want to politicize this issue, choosing to presume guilt - rather than presuming innocence - so as to discredit our lawfully elected president in the public eye,” he said.

" 40,000 MA Drug Cases Could Be Thrown Out Because Of Drug Stealing Lab Scandal","A Massachusetts crime lab scandal could result in tens of thousands of criminal convictions being overturned. It s not the first time this has happened in the state either.As Addicting Info reported in May of last year, up to 60,000 drug cases were impacted by a scandal that rocked the Hinton Drug Lab, located in Boston, MA.In that case, a chemist by the name of Annie Dookhan plead guilty to 27 criminal charges, including  tampering with evidence, violating the state witness intimidation statute, multiple counts of lying to a grand jury, falsely claiming to carry a degree and others. Over a 14 year period, Dookhan forged documents, testified falsely in criminal cases and tampered with test results while employed as a chemist at the state crime lab.After Dookhan s confession thousands of convictions were overturned and hundreds of cases, which were still pending, were dismissed.The state of MA conducted a 15-month-long investigation into the crime lab, finding  a pattern of neglect, mismanagement, and poor standards. In spite of the state s findings, no other employees faced criminal charges. The Hinton lab was eventually closed down.Now another MA drug lab is facing a massive backlash, after court documents revealed a separate scandal involving drug use, evidence tampering and a series of other crimes earlier this week.As the Boston Herald reports, Amherst state lab chemist Sonja Farak was convicted in 2014 of tampering with evidence, theft and drug use inside the crime lab, where she was employed for more than eight years.At the height of her criminal activity, Farak was smoking crack ten to twelve times a day inside the crime lab, as well as using a host of other drugs which she obtained through the lab.Farak confessed to using the drugs at her work station, where she also tested samples submitted by law enforcement.She also confessed to being high while giving testimony in criminal cases and during interviews with police.While she was convicted of multiple crimes in 2014, officials did not disclose important details about how Farak s criminal activities had likely compromised tens of thousands of cases that she worked on.It took an order from the state Supreme Court to finally bring the extent of her misconduct to light.The ACLU released a statement on the Farak case, saying: The magnitude of the Amherst Lab misconduct rivals the similar scandal at the Hinton Lab, involving disgraced chemist Annie Dookhan, and the twin Massachusetts scandals have no known parallel elsewhere in the country. Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, went on to state: There is only one sensible response to these revelations: promptly notify the people who were denied due process, undo their wrongful convictions, and rethink the unjust war on drugs. The Boston Herald reports that Farak may have tainted the results in as many as 40,000 cases during the eight years she worked as a state crime lab chemist.Combined, the Dookhan and Farak scandals in MA alone could easily have caused more than 100,000 innocent people to be wrongfully imprisoned.If rampant corruption in just two state crime labs can result in the destruction of so many lives, we have to ask ourselves what is the impact when combined with corrupt law enforcement, corrupt courts and a corrupt penal system that thrives on profit?As the ACLU states here, fighting the failed war on drugs has only served to undermine the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.It s time to end the failed drug war, once and for all.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons",News,"May 8, 2016",0

Turkish police briefly detain academic in Kurdish militant probe: agency,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish academic Fikret Baskaya was briefly detained on Monday as part of an operation targeting members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, state-run Anadolu news agency said. Twelve other suspects were detained along with Baskaya, it said. Further information about the other suspects  status was not immediately available. Baris Yarkadas, a lawmaker from the main opposition CHP, wrote on Twitter that Baskaya, 77, had been detained at his home in the capital Ankara at 6.30 am (0330 GMT) and that police had seized some of his personal possessions. Baskaya, who is an author and university lecturer, was later released after giving a statement to police, another CHP lawmaker, Murat Emir, said in a tweet.  He added that Baskaya was detained over an article he wrote on Nov. 7, called  Real Terror is State Terror,  in which Baskaya said Turkey s Kurds suffered oppression at the hands of authorities. The investigation is ongoing despite Baskaya s release, Emir said. Anadolu said arrest warrants had been issued for a total of 17 people on allegations of aiding the PKK and spreading the group s propaganda on social media. Operations to detain the other suspects were ongoing. The PKK launched a separatist insurgency in southeast Turkey in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. It is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and European Union. ",worldnews,"November 27, 2017 ",1

"U.N. says fighting stops in Sanaa, Saleh funeral expected","GENEVA (Reuters) - Yemen s capital Sanaa was quiet on Tuesday after five days of fighting that culminated in the death of ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and U.N. and Red Cross flights have landed at the airport, the United Nations said on Tuesday. Street battles in the capital had stopped despite 25 air strikes overnight, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said. The funeral of Saleh was expected later on Tuesday. He was killed by his erstwhile Houthi allies on Monday, two days after announcing he was switching sides in the war to oppose them. His family s allies have battled the Houthis since last week, a dramatic turn in a conflict that had been largely stalemated for much of the past three years. The United Nations says a food shortage caused by warring parties blocking supplies has created the world s worst humanitarian crisis. Millions of people could die in one of the worst famines of modern times.  People are now emerging from their houses after five days being locked down basically as prisoners,  McGoldrick told a regular U.N. briefing, speaking by phone from Sanaa.  They are now seeking safety, moving their families in case things erupt again and at the same time seeking medical treatment and trying to pacify very terrified kids who have endured five days of relentless shelling, shooting and ground fire and air strikes.  The air strikes overnight struck government buildings, palaces and bridges, and people were now bracing themselves in case of more fighting or air strikes, McGoldrick said, describing the situation as  very uncertain times .  We know the Saudi-led coalition has sent some messages to the people in Sanaa to stay away from Houthi installations for fear of air strikes, so we are trying to wait and see when things become slightly more clear and we can move around more freely.  A Saudi-led military coalition has been fighting on behalf of a government based in the south against the Houthis, a Shi ite movement backed by Iran that had teamed up with Saleh and controlled much of the country including the capital. So far about 125 people are known to have died in the latest fighting in the capital with 200 injured, but aid workers are likely to have a better idea of the death toll later on Tuesday, McGoldrick said. McGoldrick had no details of Saleh s funeral later on Tuesday and did not know if it would coincide or clash with an event planned by the Houthis to celebrate his killing. He said there had been a report that there would be a ceremony around the main mosque, and the U.N. mission should avoid the area because of traffic. ",worldnews,"December 5, 2017 ",1
Wild elephants trample two Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh: police,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Wild elephants trampled to death two Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh on Monday when they rampaged through a settlement where the refugees were taking shelter after fleeing a military offensive in neighboring Myanmar. More than 410,000 refugees from Myanmar have poured into Bangladesh since Aug. 25 when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts triggered a Myanmar army operation that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.  There are elephants in the forest, close to the place where many Rohingya refugees are clearing forest to make huts,  police official Chailau Murma told Reuters. An elderly person and a toddler were killed when the elephants rampaged through the area, he said. Three other people were taken to hospital to be treated for injuries, a refugee camp leader said.  Police said the elephants later disappeared back into the forest.   The refugees are facing dire conditions with insufficient food, water, medical care and shelter, and regular drenchings from monsoon rains that have turned roads into quagmires. Bangladeshi authorities say they aim to move everyone out of so-called spontaneous sites, usually beside roads where people try to make shelters wherever they are, into one big camp where aid supplies can be properly distributed.

Not only has his popularity been historically low, but his pathetic response to the recent tragedy in Charlottesville, Virginia has made him more hated than ever.It took Trump two full days to call out white supremacy and neo-Nazis as being responsible for the horrific  Unite the Right  rally and riot in Charlottesville   and now that he has, Trump is in yet another predicament. Solidifying the fact that Trump can t win no matter what he does, Trump is now in trouble with the few people who still support him   America s most racist alt-right.While Republicans have been abandoning Trump left and right, his most loyal supporters have been clinging on   until now. After Trump called out white supremacists on Monday, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke denounced Trump and bashed him for criticizing racists and the KKK.Duke went on Twitter to shred Trump for giving in to the  fake news  media and holding racists responsible for the violence that occurred at the rally. Duke must have felt quite betrayed and pissed off by Trump, because then he went over to Periscope to continue bashing Trump, calling the POTUS  statement  just ridiculous  and claiming that white nationalists aren t violent. He begged Trump to stop targeting white supremacists: President Trump, please, for God s sake, don t feel like you need to say these things. It s not going to do you any good. This temper tantrum follows Duke s post on Saturday, in reaction to Trump s weak statement on Charlottesville. Duke warned Trump to remember that he should be thanking his racist fanbase in a chilling tweet:Now that Trump has finally taken a half-ass stance against white supremacy, we can only expect that his fanbase is going to be almost nonexistent in the near future.Featured image via screenshot and Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"August 14, 2017",0
'Just talk': Belgium offers Spain relationship advice,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Amid a rising babble of advice from European neighbors on how to handle Catalonia, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy might pay attention to one country that knows something about fending off separation   Belgium. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, took a lead among European governments on Sunday after police used force to  prevent voting in a unilateral independence referendum by calling for leaders in Madrid and Barcelona to start talking.  Violence can never be the answer! We condemn all forms of violence and reaffirm our call for political dialogue,  Michel tweeted on a day when most European leaders, and the European Union authorities in Brussels, stayed silent on events in Spain. Belgium has rejigged its constitution six times in the past half century to hold together its two halves: French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders.  Three centuries after Spanish rule ended in the lands that  make up modern Belgium, a Belgian government in which Flemish nationalists play a major role feels it has something particular to say about the virtues of conversation.  Just get around the table and talk,  a Belgian government official told Reuters, summing up advice to Barcelona and Madrid.  We strongly believe that full negotiations in which all parties are included can take away that sense of frustration.  Reflecting on the three years in which Michel, a 41-year-old French-speaking Walloon centrist, has governed in coalition with the right-wing Flemish nationalist N-VA, the official said an important lesson for Belgians had been that dialogue with the separatists had substantially reined in secessionist sentiment.  The separatist tendency has declined considerably when people see that their community is being treated with respect.  Rooted in part in a history of domination by the industrial, French-speaking south during Belgium s first century or so after independence from the Netherlands in 1830, Flemish nationalism flourished as heavy industry declined and Flemings, prospering, started to resent funding welfare transfers to the Walloons. Frictions over language in universities broke out into riots in 1968 but mostly Belgium has kept a lid on communal violence, thanks in part to constitutional gymnastics that have left it a complex federal state with huge autonomy for the regions. The N-VA has muted calls for more devolution and support for independence is in single figures, polls indicate, easing fears that a Catalan secession could revive Flemish aspirations.  The pressure which has now built up in Catalonia has been negotiated away over the years in Belgium,  said Carl Devos, politics professor at the University of Ghent in Flanders. That willingness to talk endlessly over legal reforms is in contrast to what many Belgians see as an inflexibility by Rajoy to accept changing Spain s 1978 post-dictatorship constitution   and hence to negotiate a more devolved status for Catalonia. Michel made his  heartfelt  plea for an end to violence and for new dialogue after talking to some EU counterparts and to Flemish government allies on Sunday, the official said. It was not intended as an attack on Rajoy or the Spanish legal system, he said, but a response to a fear positions were hardening.  It is our trademark to deal with pressure from regions wanting more autonomy peacefully,  Devos said.  So it is not surprising that the prime minister felt the need to speak out.

U.S. allies show support for strikes on Syria,"(Reuters) - U.S. allies expressed support on Friday for Washington’s missile strikes on Syria, calling them a proportionate response to Syrian forces’ suspected use of chemical weapons.  The strikes were denounced as illegal by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on the world ""to reject such policies, which bring only destruction and danger to the region and the globe"". (Graphic locator map on attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nm68H0)  Iraq criticized “hasty interventions” in an apparent comment on the U.S. action. But a wide range of U.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support, if sometimes cautiously, in similar terms. “The U.K. government fully supports the U.S. action, which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime and is intended to deter further attacks,” a British government spokesman said. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters: “Many innocent people became victims from the chemical attacks. “Japan supports the U.S. government’s determination to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons,” he said. Turkey viewed the strikes positively and the international community should sustain its stance against the “barbarity” of the Syrian government, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said. In an interview with Turkish broadcaster Fox TV, Kurtulmus said Assad’s government must be punished in the international arena and the peace process in Syria needed to be accelerated. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran needed to understand that supporting Assad made no sense and that the escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria was a “warning” to “a criminal regime”. “Use of chemical weapons is appalling and should be punished because it is a war crime,” Ayrault told Reuters and France Info radio. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued statements saying Assad was solely to blame for the air strikes. The Dutch government said: “The United States has given a clear signal that the use of poison gas crosses a line.” It also labeled the strikes a “proportionate” response. “U.S. strikes show needed resolve against barbaric chemical attacks. EU will work with the US to end brutality in Syria,” the chairman of the council of EU leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Twitter. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the strikes sent “a vitally important message” that the world would not tolerate the use of chemical weapons. “The retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift,” he told reporters in Sydney. “We support the United States in that swift action.” Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which back rebels fighting Assad, said they supported the U.S. strikes and held only the Syrian government responsible for the attacks. Other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, also expressed support for the attacks.  Some countries expressed reservations about the U.S. decision to launch strikes without authorization from the U.N. Security Council. Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. “At the same time, Indonesia is concerned with unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in responding to the chemical weapon attack tragedy in Syria,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said in a text message. “Military actions, undertaken without prior authorization of the U.N. Security Council, are not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes, as stipulated in the U.N. Charter.” ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2017 ",1

Jury deadlocks over tax-evasion charges against Washington state auditor,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - A jury did not convict Washington state’s auditor on money-laundering and tax-evasion charges on Tuesday in a blow to federal prosecutors who argued that the Democrat had “spun a web of lies” to avoid paying taxes and defraud thousands of homeowners. The jury in Tacoma also acquitted Troy Kelley, 51, of a single charge of making a false statement to IRS agents in April 2013 after about four days of deliberation following more than five weeks of trial.  “This is the first step toward vindication for him,” Angelo Calfo, a defense attorney for Kelley, said by telephone.  The criminal allegations against Kelley focus on his former document-tracking business for title companies during real estate sales and refinancing transactions in which he is accused of pocketing roughly $3 million in fees that should have been returned to borrowers from at least 2003 to 2008. A grand jury indicted Kelley, a Democrat elected in 2012, a year ago for his alleged scheme to keep stolen money and hide it from both the Internal Revenue Service and those due a refund for home purchases or mortgage refinancings.  Among the charges Kelley faced was one count of possession and concealment of stolen property related to processing fees that should have been returned to borrowers.  He also faced charges of failing to pay federal taxes, obstructing related IRS collections, money laundering, attempted obstruction of a civil lawsuit, and filing false income tax returns. It was not immediately clear what would happen with the remaining charges, Calfo said. Federal prosecutors could seek to re-try the case, or the judge could grant Kelley’s motion to dismiss the charges, he said. After a grand jury indicted Kelley last year, U.S. Attorney Annette Hayes said that he “spun a web of lies in an effort to avoid paying his taxes and keep more than a million dollars that he knew did not belong to him, but instead should have been returned to thousands of homeowners across this state.” Hayes said in a statement on Tuesday that her office “will thoroughly review the counts that the jury deadlocked on before making a decision about our next steps in this case.” A judge blocked a recall effort as Kelley fought the charges and he took a leave of absence to prepare his defense. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, has called for Kelley’s resignation. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
U.S waives Jones Act to secure fuel for hurricane responders,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday said it was temporarily waiving a law that limits the availability of cargoes on the U.S. coasts, a step that will ensure enough fuel reaches emergency responders during Hurricane Irma and in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.  The Jones Act mandates the use of U.S.-flagged vessels to transport merchandise between U.S. coasts. The Department of Homeland Security waived the requirement for one week. This will allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax-free, or more readily available foreign-flagged vessels. Harvey, which hit Texas with record floods, had a wider effect of disrupting fuel distribution across Florida, Georgia and other Southeastern states by shutting refineries and pipelines.  With Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, expected to hit Florida in days, the region will experience “one of the largest mass evacuations in American history” and see historic levels of restoration and response crews, said Elaine Duke, acting secretary of Homeland Security. Waiving the Jones Act will ensure there is fuel to support lifesaving efforts and restore services and infrastructure in the wake of the storm, Duke said.  ",politicsNews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Trump to target Obama's climate initiatives: White House website,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s administration is committed to eliminating Barack Obama’s Climate Action Plan and other environmental initiatives to help boost the oil and gas industry, according to a statement posted on the White House website on Friday. The announcement echoed pledges Trump frequently made during his campaign to become U.S. president, but their appearance on the White House website makes them his official policy. (bit.ly/2iK2JQp) “President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,” the website said. All references to climate change appeared to have been removed from the White House website, a word search showed. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday.     Former President Obama’s climate plan proposed cuts to U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, in part by preserving forests and encouraging increased use of cleaner renewable fuels. Trump has expressed skepticism about whether human activity drives climate change, and he has railed against Obama’s efforts to combat it by targeting carbon dioxide emissions.  Trump has also suggested he could pull the United States out of a climate pact agreed by nearly 200 nations. The statement on the White House website said that Trump’s efforts to boost the U.S. oil and gas sector would help increase government revenues to “rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure,” and lower the price of energy.  The statement said Trump’s administration would free the nation from dependence on foreign oil, and was “committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America’s coal industry, which has been hurting for too long.” An overwhelming majority of scientists say the burning of coal, oil and gas is a driver of global climate change, causing sea level rise and more frequent violent storms.

"FBI, Homeland Security chiefs preparing for violence at political conventions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers on Thursday that they were preparing their agencies for the possibility of violence, both from unruly demonstrators and terrorists, at the upcoming Republican and Democratic nominating conventions.  Speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee, Johnson said he was concerned that demonstrations at the events could get out of hand. In an interview with Reuters following his testimony, Johnson said he knew of no specific or credible threat to either convention but that it was important to be prepared.   Johnson said the Department of Homeland Security would be sending more than 3,000 personnel to each convention.  Recent clashes between attendees and protesters at rallies for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have led to physical assaults and arrests. The Republican National Convention being held July 18-21 in Cleveland and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25-28 follow a string of high-profile shootings. In June, an Islamic State sympathizer committed the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, killing 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Last week, five police officers in Dallas were killed by a black man angry about police shootings of unarmed black men. Comey told the committee that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was monitoring the threat of violence at the conventions “very, very carefully.”     “Anytime there is a national spotlight on a political event in the United States, there is a risk that groups that aspire to do just that, engage in acts of domestic terrorism, will be attracted,” Comey said.

 E-mails Show Coordination Between Mayor’s Office And Chicago PD Over Laquan McDonald Shooting,"New e-mails obtained by media outlets show that there was coordination between the Chicago Police Department, the Independent Police Review Board, and the Mayor Rahm Emanuel s office over video footage that shows Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke shoot Laquan McDonald 16 times.Chicago activists and others have hammered the Rahm administration over the delayed release of the video. McDonald was shot to death in October, 2014. Yet, the video of the shooting was not released until November 24, 2015. McDonald was killed by the Chicago Police Department during Chicago s mayoral election. Releasing the video would have been put the Emanuel under national scrutiny. This has led many to believe that the Mayor s office and the CPD were working in a collaborative effort to delay the release of the video to avoid being hurt politically.In one e-mail, attorney Jeffrey J. Neslund explained to city lawyers that the video is going to be very bad for the city. I submit the graphic dash cam video will have a powerful impact on any jury and the Chicago community as a whole. This case will undoubtedly bring a microscope of national attention to the shooting itself as well as the city s pattern, practice and procedures in rubber-stamping fatal police shootings of African Americans as  justified.' Critics of Emanuel and major media publications have called for Rahm Emanuel to resign.The Associated Press reports that the e-mails that were released shows that Emanuel s aids were well aware that releasing the video would be politically explosive. One e-mail in late July even showed that Emanuel s aids were concerned that people that people were beginning to view the case as a cover up. As you might imagine, the timing and details discussed in the Sun-Times article and growing interest in the McDonald incident has not worked in our favor, and is helping to  stir the pot,'  Emanuel aide Vance Henry wrote.In another e-mail, Henry wrote in October, saying that officials would be  smart to act timely and strategically  in reference to McDonald s death and another case where a Chicago police officer killed a 22-year-old woman named Rekia Boyd.These e-mails will not help the Mayor s office convince people that the delay of the video was not politically motivated.This alleged cover up is not the only  sin  that is  catching up to  Emanuel, as Rick Perlstein describes  The Sudden But Well-Deserved Fall of Rahm Emanuel  in The New Yorker. Emanuel s political career has been defined by his war against teachers, privatization schemes, and his efforts to make the Democratic Party unrecognizable from the Republican Party by fighting against  liberal theology,  as he describes it.Featured Image Credit: Daniel X.

ARIZONA BIKERS ARE ABOUT To Become Violent “Dreamers” Worst Nightmare At Upcoming Phoenix Trump Rally," The Left has been itching for a fight the only problem is, they ve been itching for a fight against Trump supporters who re outnumbered so they can t fight back. They may be biting off a bit more than they can chew this time around A group of bikers said it plans to protect supporters from possible violence at a Donald Trump rally scheduled to be held in Phoenix on Saturday. We re going to stand between them and any protesters that come onto the property and hopefully protect them from any bodily harm, should it get to that point,  Cindy Perrin with Lions Guard Arizona said.The rally is expected to begin Saturday about 4 p.m. at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the Arizona State Fairgrounds near 19th Avenue and McDowell Road.The protest will be held at nearby Encanto Park from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.Perrin said the biker group, made up mostly of retired police officers, such as herself, and veterans, will be wearing American flag bandanas so they are easy to identify. If they have any problems, they ll be able to locate us and ask us for help,  she said.Perrin said her group is not expecting things to take a violent turn outside of Trump s rally, unlike several events the presumptive Republican presidential nominee hosted in California. We re not expecting it to get to that point in Arizona,  she said.The bikers will not be the only group attempting to keep things calm on Saturday. Arizona Department of Public Safety Capt. Damon Cecil said his organization has reached out to groups both for and against Trump. Most of those groups   not all, but most of those groups   we have talked to their leadership and got assurances their protests were going to be peaceful,  he said.Protest organizers are also hoping things remain civil. My message to the folks that want to protest is: You know what? Why don t you pick up a clipboard, let s get some voter registrations and get some more families registered to vote who will vote against Trump come November,  Tony Navarette with Promise Arizona said.DREAM Act advocate Carmen Cornejo said protesters who act violently are doing nothing more than falling into line with Trump s rhetoric.

YEAR IN REVIEW: 2017 Top Ten Conspiracies,"Patrick Henningsen and Shawn Helton 21st Century WireOnce again, we ve arrived at our New Years Eve wrap-up of some of the most compelling and conspiratorial stories of the year. Like in years past, 2017 presented a polarizing political landscape, further exposing the current establishment paradigm. Unlike the establishment gatekeepers, when we use the word  conspiracy  here, we are talking about a real crime scene. Whether it was the ousting of thousands of western-backed terrorists in Iraq and Syria or a string of  known wolf  attacks amplified by made-to-order media agitprop, or the heavily manufactured Russia-gate narrative relentlessly pushed by mainstream outlets and Deep State actors    it seemed there was no shortage of topsy-turvy stagecraft designed to mislead and confuse the masses at a time when the real world is undergoing some significant geopolitical realignments.As was the case in 2016, there were many high-profile incidents and individual stories which didn t make our annual compendium (but they are worth mentioning)   like the  red herring  laced New Year s Eve mass shooting at Turkey s Reina nightclub that kicked off 2017 in classic Daily Shooter fashion, along with other dubious events like Fort Lauderdale s FBI-known shooter and subsequent CNN media circus. On the political front, it was a banner year for astroturfing starting with  The Resistance  which spent most of the first 3 months of the year demanding Trump s impeachment before he had served 100 days in office. As part of these efforts, we saw Hollywood and the Democratic Party s choreographed women s march backed by political agitator and perennial globalist George Soros, as well as MoveOn.org and other Soros-backed protests which followed Trump s highly controversial immigration ban, as contentious resignations by key members of the Trump White House loomed large. The stage was then set for Antifa s US  riot tour  which culminated the Charlottesville riots in Virginia followed by a series of  social justice  protests over Confederate statues, followed by more extremist left-wing  antifascists  foot-soldiers like  black bloc  throwing molotov cocktails and smashing buildings for kicks. And that only scratches the surface of what transpired in 2017.Other notable stories throughout the year included the Trump administration s decision to announce the creation of an  Arab NATO headquartered in Saudi Arabia, the world s second-largest state sponsored of terror (US being the largest).  That geopolitical gambit then teed up the Trump White House to announce that the US Embassy in Tel Aviv would begin proceedings to move to Jerusalem, a shift which some critics believe is further evidence of an ultra-Zionist agenda encroaching on Israeli-occupied Palestine and the West Bank. On the Asia front, questions emerged over what North Korea actually has in terms of ICBM missiles and a nuclear deterrent, while in the Middle East speculation raged about Saudi Arabia s historic palace purge and sabre rattling in the region. The year then saw the exposure of a giant US-NATO-Saudi weapons trafficking operation using diplomatic flight in order to arm terrorists in Syria and Iraq. 2017 also saw the mainstream media continue to market the media construct known as Bana of Aleppo, expecting the public to believe that an 8 year old girl who could not speak English was running a Twitter account from war-torn (and terrorist-occupied) East Aleppo from the autumn of 2016   all the while waxing poetic about the evil Assad, and the evil Russians and calling for US military intervention in Syria  pure propaganda and a clear case of child exploitation. Interestingly, this outlandish Bana propaganda myth campaign has been shamelessly promoted by the multimillionaire Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling. 2017 also saw a wave of intelligence releases, set in motion by the CIA, who released more than 12 million documents pertaining to covert war programs, psychic research and the Cold War era, further outlining the symbiotic relationship between the agency and American media. This was followed by Wikileaks exposing much of the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities in their  Vault 7  and later in their  Vault 8  publications. Towards the end of the year, a new twist in the downing of MH17 revealed an apparent Netherlands cover-up, as another bizarre Daily Shooter event, the Texas Church shooting, would later disappear from headlines. Around the same time frame, new questions also emerged in the Sandy Hook saga concerning prior knowledge of the FBI, as New York was then stricken by a known wolf truck attacker. In December it was finally announced that after being held in prison for two years without trial, the Fed s Bundy Ranch Standoff case was declared a mistrial. However, most of the year s controversial stories were quickly pushed to the back page, buried underneath an avalanche of ready-to-go Weinstein-inspired sex abuse scandals involving Hollywood s elite punctuated by obligatory hashtag campaigns like #MeToo, before snagging a number of high-profile news media personalities and some of Washington s most coveted swamp dwellers. As an onslaught of new accusations flooded the media, the sordid revelation of a Congressional slush fund used to payoff sexual harassment accusers made headlines. The whole situation conjured DC s Conspiracy of Silence regarding tales of sexual misconduct in days past.All in all, it was another year of  hyper-real  media propaganda, as some stories published by mainstream media led to a cascade of retractions and corrections, and in certain cases, provided an all to convenient mask for other politically charged news throughout much of 2017. Unlike the mainstream media  official  conspiracies (like Russiagate), these ones are actually real  10.  The JFK Files  Over the course of 2017, one of America s most compelling conspiracies was reignited following the release of thousands of intelligence files long-held by the CIA and FBI. In late October, the Trump administration called for the release of the remaining JFK files, citing the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act deadline placed into law in 1992. While the material released was reportedly a mix of new and old, some critics declared that the recently declassified files revealed even more startling evidence related to the assassination of the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. This prompted larger legacy media establishments to provide a murky retelling of the JFK saga.  Predictably, a week after the releases, one newer CIA memo stated that any links between the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald, were  unfounded.  In essence, the JFK file releases appear to have been a way for the political powers that be to shut the door on a conspiracy that has an overwhelming amount of information suggesting CIA links not only to Oswald, but many of the characters surrounding the case. In reality though, as newfound interest in the JFK files was reawakened, it cast light on the over five decade old case, reopening the door to coup d tat claims concerning JFK and Cold War era  false flag  terror. In particular, terror created by Operation GLADIO, a CIA-NATO construct, which utilized covert armies to subvert the political interests of various nations through the implementation of a Cold-War era strategy of tension. The further one digs into America s seedy underworld of organized crime, intelligence operations, unlikely coincidences and secretive relationships concerning the mysterious plot to kill Kennedy, a highly intricate web of activity emerges that points to a compelling case beyond almost any other modern-day conspiracy.9. Grenfell Tower Fire & Cover-Up   It was Britain s biggest domestic disaster post WWII, and from the minute this story broke, reports of government and corporate corruption began to surface. This real-life Towering Inferno featured some of the most surreal revelations, including a corrupt government Qango known as TMO (Tenant Management Organisation) who had paid a contractor to install highly flammable petroleum-based  cladding  on the building, supposedly to meet  green sustainability goals  but also to cover-up what wealthy property developers deemed as an eye sore (social housing high rise building), part of London s continuous and rampant  gentrification  property bubble agenda. The controversy did not stop with the fire itself though, as residents and concerned members of the public began to question the abnormally low death count which was being trumpeted by the media and the government agencies. Meanwhile, thousands of residents from Grenfell Tower and the surrounding buildings continued to suffer and mourn the loss of loved ones and friends   leaving in indellible scar on the community   while the government s elite Common Purpose management class continued on with business as usual. Six months on,  the public is still wondering whether anyone will be arrested, or held to account for this unprecedented story of criminal negligence. In one of its most seminal episodes, the SUNDAY WIRE radio show, along with its affiliate the UK Column, drove the investigative agenda early on in this story, with the mainstream media later picking talking points covered by this independent media outlet.8. The Crisis in Yemen   Back in January 2015   while the world was focused on the war in Syria, 21WIRE first raised the alarm over Yemen after it noticed the insatiable war-time president Barack Obama, along with Deep State and Pentagon media outlet CNN began drifting out talking points about Yemen. It wasn t long after that, in March 2015, that Saudi Arabia   with the full military and political backing of the US and UK, began an undeclared war of aggression against Saudi s neighbor Yemen. Nearly three years on, with tens of thousands slaughtered by Saudi airstrikes dropping their newly purchased US and UK munitions (and even enjoying air refueling by the US military) and with the Saudi and US military blockade which is keeping much-needed humanitarian aid from entering the war-ravaged country leading to mass starvation and disease outbreaks like cholera on the peninsula   why isn t the international community calling out the illegal war against Yemen for what it is   genocide? In order to prop-up their fake narrative on Yemen, the US and UK mainstream media conglomerates and their state propaganda directors from intelligence agency information warfare units have concocted a new batch of official disinformation lies and myths used to muddy the waters of this important discussion and ultimately justify their slaughter and arms sales bonanza in Yemen. On balance, what the US, UK and Saudi Arabia have done to Yemen is by orders of magnitude worse than what Nazi Germany did to its neighbors in the initial phase of WWII. Nothing less than a new Nuremberg Trial will be suitable to help correct this act of international barbarism.7. London s GLADIO-style Attacks  On March 22nd, an apparent two-pronged terror attack stretched from London s Westminster Bridge to Parliament Square. In the days leading up to the London attacks, it was revealed that Met Police rehearsed a  terrifyingly realistic drill on the River Thames prior to yet another known wolf act of terror taking place. Adding to the drama, the London attacks occurred exactly one year after the Brussels airport bombings. In addition, the bizarre and unexpected event took place during a massive uptick of Western allied involvement in the Syrian conflict and in less than 24 hours, London authorities revealed that the British-born attacker named Khalid Masood, (after media outlets erroneously reported the wrong suspect) was already well-known to MI5 and had worked in Saudi Arabia sometime between 2005-2008. Shortly after the attack, it was revealed that eye-witnesses reported seeing multiple assailants at the crime scene, this was something that directly contradicted the official story. In fact, in those reports, it was suggested that at least two individuals participated in the large-scale attack in one of the most heavily surveilled parts of London. This aspect of the case was quickly buried by major media outlets, echoing other high-profile cases involving  known wolf  terrorists. In recent years, there s been a pattern of multiple suspects often witnessed or said to be involved in other terror-related events. This proved to be the case in the aftermath of the Nice, France truck attack, as well as the Brussels airport bombing in 2016. Rather incredibly or unbelievably, London s acting Police Commissioner Craig Mackey, just so happened to be at the scene to  witness  the Parliament Square attack on Pc Keith Palmer. All in all, the latest symbolically charged  ISIS-approved  attack on the verge of spring, appeared to be an effort to polarize the perception of Western viewers with yet another round of wartime propaganda, while also providing a media smoke screen for recent US military action in Syria. By early summer, just after the Manchester arena bombing, London once again became a target of a purported multi-pronged terror event right on the heels of the UK s hotly contested 2017 general election. Afterwards, a number of questions were raised following the London Bridge attacks, just as there were following the Parliament Square, Westminster Bridge attacks and the Manchester Arena attack. It s important to note the common thread between each suspicious event, and the recent UK attacks are no exception   there s now indisputable evidence linking MI5 and MI6 British security services to various  known wolves  prior to carrying out the terror crimes mentioned above. The precarious relationship between security and terror is an ongoing pattern seen after almost every major terror attack on Western soil. Throughout 2017, the London attacks seemed to increase racial and ethnic tensions in the West, while also pushing the public into accepting a more direct military intervention in Syria, and new police state measures and surveillance powers in the UK   prompting us to ask, who benefited the most from the London Attacks? We d say the answer to that question is pretty obvious now 6. Manchester s  Known Wolf  Arena Attack  Another day, another conspiratorial crime. In this case, the public was witness to yet another known wolf  terror attack allegedly carried out by an  ISIS-inspired  individual who, as with numerous other cases, was under the gaze of MI5. The man named in the Manchester bombing attack, Salman Abedi, was also tied to a terror group supported by NATO in Libya during the operation to oust Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. The Manchester arena attack proved to be more than just blowback from security operations gone awry, it provided further evidence of complicity on behalf of the West in the  War On Terror  era. While some researchers and analysts were a buzz with the numerological synchronicities associated with the Manchester attack, others noted some very real political circumstances and significant timelines surrounding this apparent mass-tragedy in Manchester. The event just happened to arrive on the heels of a monolithic arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $110 billion dollars that will total $350 billion over the next 10 years, and only shortly after the Manchester attack, there were US-led coalition airstrikes supposedly targeting ISIS in both Syria and Iraq   that killed 121 civilians in the process. The strikes led to increased tension, placing external pressure on the Russian-led Astana Peace Agreement in Syria, while continuing to benefit the strategic movements of ISIS in Syria. The really damning link however, was exposed by one major UK Government eyesore after the Manchester attacks: the revelation that a community of  outlawed  Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) terrorists were in fact living in close proximity to the Manchester attacker Abedi, and directly connected to Abedi himself. This was a deeply troubling development for a public unaware of the nearby danger, as British security services and officials allowed this  thriving  group of fighters to reside in the UK seemingly without consequence or disclosure of their previous activities   until the Manchester attack. So naturally, when it was revealed that Ramadan Abedi (the father of the purported Manchester suicide bomber) was also a member of the UK government-backed Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and was believed to have been a part of LIFG during the NATO-backed regime change operation in Libya in 2011   it only raised more questions concerning the attack. It s worth noting, Libya s militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, was also a part of the Mujahideen fighters closely linked to Bin Laden who became known as al-Qaeda. In fact, Belhadj returned to his home country [in 1995] as head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, an underground paramilitary organisation dedicated to Gaddafi s downfall. Over the years, Belhadj was incarcerated and turned loose back into the field after being rendered by the CIA and British security services. As of 2015, despite the Manchester attack links to LIFG, the group is still on the US State Department s Delisted Foreign Terrorist Organizations. In the days after the attack, authorities released CCTV imagery apparently depicting the Manchester attacker Abedi, in what appeared to be a way to dramatize the bombing through emotionally charged imagery, as the media obscured other facts and connections observed in the aftermath of the attack itself. The Manchester attack was similar to other high-profile incidents used to distort public opinion in the wake of media styled mass-tragedies.5.  The Las Vegas Mass Shooting   October 1st marked the return of the Great American Mass Shooting   a real record-breaker, complete with a shocking mile-long crime scene that stretched from the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to the nearby Route 91 Festival, where thousands of concertgoers suddenly became a target. Although America had seen a host of smaller, less sensationalized mass shootings throughout the course of 2017, including the bizarre Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting and the strange Programmed to Kill Texas Church shooting, the high-profile Las Vegas calamity resuscitated the trauma inducing imagery so prevalent in the post-9/11 War On Terror era. This made-for-TV event was designed for media shock and awe, like  the 9/11 of Mass Shootings.  Over the past several years, 21WIRE has chronicled many bizarre shootings and mass casualty incidents that have rippled across America and Europe. These events have become a new kind of ritualized  crimescape  moving well beyond  security  concerns, but now accompanied by a complete range of  socio-political mainstream media talking points including race, religion,  gun reform ,  social media concerns  and domestic extremism   while concurrently obscuring and obfuscating the forensic reality of the crimes themselves. We re told that this tragic shooting attack was carried out by a classic  lone gunman    one individual without a criminal past (or nay past, as far as we could tell)  but there proved to be much more to the story. Adding to this  hyper-real  incident, the main suspect in the Las Vegas tragedy was also revealed to be a multi-millionaire  players club  member, 64 year-old Stephen Paddock. With no motive and no criminal history, Las Vegas police were tasked with uncovering details of a crime overseen by billionaire bosses at MGM Resorts International and the FBI. As authorities failed to uncover a clear motive for the crime, police scanner audio, along with eye-witness testimony suggested that multiple shooters may have been at the scene, although this aspect was downplayed by mainstream media. This was quickly followed by several official  revisions  in the timeline of the shooting and even the crime scene itself, as evidenced by this disastrous press conference which failed to yield any new information in the case. The star-witness of the shooting, Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, also vanished and was declared  missing  right before a major media interview, only to resurface much later on the oddest of media venues,  The Ellen DeGeneres Show,  giving media gatekeepers the chance to run interference for DeGeneres s slot machine business partners at MGM. Along the way, bizarre media performances by Paddock s brother, Eric Paddock, only prompted more questions and deepened the mystery surrounding this surreal case. While the public waited for MGM to release CCTV footage of the alleged shooter Paddock, not one tape materialized, except for an older tape from 2011. Staged photos of the Mandalay Bay crime scene led to other forensic questions concerning the weaponry used, compounding other acoustic anomalies already noted. Other confusing elements of the case included the missing hard drive from Paddock s laptop, another brother s arrest, the wiring of $100,000 to his live-in girlfriend s (Marilou Danley) home country, the Philippines, Paddock s previous employment at the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin, a reported break-in at one of his homes after the shooting, the absurd insertion of an  ISIS-inspired  motive (which a number of dubious click-bait media outlets ran with), and later seeing a back drop of active shooter related drills and government activity, along with details suggesting Paddock may not have been alone and much more. In the search for answers in America s largest-ever mass shooting, months later, we still have yet to see any CCTV footage of the alleged killer or his whereabouts leading up to the tragedy, as he moved in and around Las Vegas. Imagine that: no CCTV footage. While some have attempted to make sense of the Las Vegas shooting tragedy, there are reports of a major push to revamp security in the hospitality industry through the use of gunfire detection systems, X-ray, body scanners and facial recognition in the wake of this confusing, if not partly manufactured event. The popular media concept of a lone wolf killer in today s world has reprogrammed the public mind in the very same way that the serial killer phenomenon did decades ago. This new fear-based saga has ushered in a string of improbable Hollywood-style scenarios, inducing a frozen apathy across the masses. Rather than looking deeply at crime scene forensics or pouring over piles of collected data, these Daily Shooter crimes hold the public psyche hostage  until the next unexplained mass tragedy. Until the next episode 4. Syria s Sarin Gas False Flag  In less than 24 hours after the highly dubious alleged chemical attack on April 4th (reported to be Sarin gas by Western media) in Khan Shaykhun in the Idlib province of Syria, wide-scale unsubstantiated condemnation laid blame at the doorstep of the Syrian government and Russia following the release of video footage that had yet to be forensically scrutinized. In fact, the mainstream media flooded the airwaves with a bevy of circumstantial and speculative evidence   a far cry from actual hard evidence. Leaders in Washington and Western media outlets once again set the stage for wider military intervention in Syria. Days after the release of a forensically unproven chemical attack out of Khan Shaykhun, US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on the Syrian government s Shayrat Air Base in response to the alleged chemical attack in Idlib. Trump s missile strike won him instant praise from the Pentagon media oracle CNN, as well as giddy celebrations by war-mongering neocons in the US. Perhaps the most telling aspect of  Syria s most recent mass casualty terror tragedy, was the suspicious involvement of the US-UK-NATO-Gulf state backed NGO known as the White Helmets  a group who once again was witnessed in wartime imagery that was not only full of anomalies but a production designed to evoke an emotional response rather than one based in rationality. Since their inception in late 2013, the White Helmets have largely conducted their so-called rescue operations in rebel-terrorist held areas in Syria, while producing an unprecedented amount of western-oriented war propaganda for nations deeply invested in arming and backing rebel-terrorists vying for regime change in Syria. Nearly two weeks after the alleged sarin gas attack, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Professor Theodore Postol directly disputed claims concerning the official US report regarding the alleged chemical weapons attack out of Khan Shaykhun in the  rebel-held  terrorist-occupied Idlib province of Syria. Postol s initial analysis, along with its addendum, appeared to echo what MIT research affiliate and former US Congressional staffer Subrata Ghoshroy observed in the aftermath of the Syrian chemical incident in East Ghouta, Damascus in 2013. In addition, other award-winning American journalists like Seymour Hersh and Gareth Porter also exposed the  sarin attack  narrative as a fabrication promulgated by a corrupt OPCW   but their reports were muted by mainstream gatekeepers. Both apparent attacks in Damascus and Idlib, were claimed through the presentation of dubious video imagery and suspicious photographs as a main source of evidence. Despite the absence of any real forensic investigation, the western media proclaimed  certainty  over images and videos largely supplied by the dubious  NGO  known as the  White Helmets.  It would later be revealed that on April 4th, the Syrian Air Force had also struck a warehouse in Idlib where chemical weapons were said to have been produced and stockpiled by US-backed militants. What was most disturbing, was that many in US-UK leadership seemed desperate for the public to buy into any WMD claims without concrete proof and in the process, they deliberately pushed heavily propagandized imagery presented on social media as proof of the as yet forensically unproven sarin gas attack. In essence, the whole event became a wag the dog moment ensnaring not only the White House, but many leaders in the UK as well.3. White Helmets Fraud   The White Helmets. Who are they, who created them, who funds them, and which master do they serve in Syria? In the US and in Europe, these fundamental questions routinely go unanswered by the western mainstream media organizations and government officials. Since first appearing on the western media scene in late 2013, the UK and US government-funded pseudo  NGO  known as the White Helmets has achieved cult-like status as their pictures adorn the front pages of newspapers and CNN breaking news segments about Syria. For the last 4 years, their principle function has been to produce a steady stream of  anti-Assad regime  and anti-Russian propaganda tailored for western audiences. Since 2015, 21WIRE led the way in asking these important questions, and in 2017 the overwhelming pressure of mounting evidence of the White Helmet fraud eventually led to various shoddy academics in the US and in the UK mainstream media outlets attacking 21WIRE and its writers for challenging the official White Helmets narrative   and for exposign how the UK government has been channeling hundreds of millions of pounds into terrorist-occupied areas of Syria under the thin guise building  civil society  (US and UK trojan horse) organizations in Syria. Establishment attacks included one mainstream media outlet promoting the White Helmets, The Guardian newspaper in the UK. According to The Guardian anyone who dared to question their official government-sanctioned narrative were  conspiracy theorists  and somehow part of a secret  Russian-backed propaganda campaign.  Despite mountains of evidence including various fake rescue videos, colluding in acts of murder and extreme violence and evidence which clearly depicts the dodgy  search and rescue  groups  members as dual members in armed al Qaeda terrorist affiliates operating in  rebel-held  opposition areas of Syria   western mainstream media are still determined to play dumb on this issue, which only goes to prove just how ignorant mainstream gatekeepers are as to the realities on the ground in Syria, or worse   how controlled are mainstream editors  desks by the western intelligence apparatus. Either way, Toto has already drawn the Wizard s curtain all the way back   and it s only a question of time before western media apologists and clueless politicians retreat into full  no comment  mode on this issue.2. The Russia-Gate PsyOp   It s been 18 months since the Democratic Party and the US mainstream media launched its  Russia-gate  narrative, claiming that Moscow had hacked the DNC, John Podesta and somehow influenced the result of the US 2016 Presidential Election. 18 months later, there s still no evidence to substantiate this mainstream conspiracy theory   making Russiagate easily the biggest fake news story of the year. What s most telling about this  official  conspiracy theory (as it turns out, it s the mainstream that peddles the grandest conspiracy theories) is that its proponents have to resort to publishing repeated lies and wild exaggerations in order to maintain the pillars supporting their narrative. So desperate were the New York Times to tie Trump to Russia that it even claimed that  the Russians  where creating Facebook pages about puppies in order to  confuse and mislead  vulnerable American voters. New York Times also had to retract their central lie which claimed that 17 US Intelligence agencies had all agreed that the Russians meddled in the 2016 presidential election   but still we hear legions of mindless  journalists  and shaky politicians like Adam Schiff (who, not surprisingly is also promoting the White Helmets) repeating that same old canard. As part of Washington s new McCarthyite red scare reboot, the US government labeled Russian international media network RT, and RT America as  foreign agents    forcing the channel and its journalists to register with the US government under old outdated pre-WWII espionage legislation. Other fake claims by US media include  Kremlin bots  deployed on Facebook to mess with the fragile minds of potential voters on social media, and CNN s all-time classic: an  Exclusive!  no less   claiming that the Russians somehow infiltrated the computer game Pokemon Go in order to  sow confusion among Americans.  Honestly, we couldn t make it up if we tried. What s beyond ironic is that the same media who has been constantly crying  fake news!  as their prime talking point to explain how Trump beat Clinton   has been dutifully recycling their own fake news narrative for over a year now. This one will surely go down in history as the biggest political hoax of all-time   and all of the mainstream media outlets who helped promulgate this myth should also go down with it. Sadly, too many mentally-challenged lawmakers in the US, UK and Europe are actually basing their foreign policies of this mainstream fake news myth   which is all too convenient for an ever-inflating the US defense budget, NATO s breakneck expansion eastward, and also for Brussels  new roll-out of its EU Army  1.  Fake News 2.0    2017 was the year of fake news. Last year, we crowned Fake News 1.0 as our top conspiracy, but this past year has seen it ascend to an entirely new level. From the beginning, this faux crisis had a clear set of political objectives. The first was to provide a scapegoat for Hillary Clinton s catastrophic imploding presidential run, and secondly, to try and prop-up the establishment s official conspiracy theory that somehow the Russians were spreading  fake news  across social media and alternative media websites   in order to help Donald Trump win the election. On this front, many of us are indebted to Trump for branding CNN with the meme that keeps sticking, as the President hit CNN s bumbling White House correspondent Jim Acosta, with Trump pointing to Acosta and saying,  You are fake news!  live on national TV. If was a glorious moment for sure. Newspapers like the Washington Post performed a key role for the US Deep State by pushing-out fictional news features like the one claiming 200 of the leading alternative media websites were part of some Kremlin-orchestrated network of websites carrying out  active measures  (a defunct Cold War term) propaganda against the American people. The Post even presented a bogus anonymous construct, a website called  PropOrNot  in order to try and make their conspiracy theory look official. Around the same time, a radical progressive academic from Merrimack College in Massachusetts published a  fake news list    a database and virtual  blacklist  designed to defame and slander any independent media outlets who happened to veer from the party line and challenge the policies of Hillary Clinton and Obama. Dr. Zimdars heavily politicized  list  was promoted by  the LA Times which, like the fraudulent story published in The Post, claimed that hundreds of alternative media websites were producing  fake news  and  conspiracy  stories and therefore were unreliable as information sources. It wasn t long before the establishment began referencing these politicized lists, holding them up as  proof  of some crisis in what the liberal intelligensia proudly dubbed a  post-truth  world. Despite the establishment s insistence on pushing this faux crisis, an increasing number of smart news consumers came to realize that for at least the last century and half, the establishment s tightly-controlled information syndicate has been able to manufacture its own consensus reality through the use of their own  official  fake news. By channeling public opinion in this way, the mainstream press has helped facilitate a number of engineered outcomes   including war. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the fake news  circus, is that Silicon Valley monopolies like Google and Facebook have taken it upon themselves to manipulate their online platforms in such a way that they are choosing which websites and news sources will be  de-ranked  and effectively hidden from the view of most users, and, in the case of Facebook   censoring real information presented by independent, non mainstream journalists, but allowing political operatives to abuse their problematic  communitarian  information policing system to strike off  offensive  content. As a result a number of leading alternative commentators have been banned from Facebook for completely illegitimate reasons. Finally, we can reveal the  2.0  aspect of the establishment s  fake news  faux crisis   a false pretext to unleash a wide-ranging program of internet censorship   and it s already begun. Reasonable people should be under no illusions: Google Inc, Facebook and global monopolies like them it are the closest thing to a classic fascist-corporatist behemoth you will find in the world today. Both Google and Facebook are both actively colluding with big government and other mainstream media partners, and are guilty of  stealth censoring  through either their A.I. filtering algorithms, or through flagged websites on a database used to de-rank leading independent and anti-war sites like 21st Century Wire, Anti-War.com, Consortium News, Global Research and countless others. Furthermore, Facebook is now on record as admitting to colluding with both the US and Israeli governments to delete  undesirable  accounts. This is a corporation which is now actively and opening violating US laws, which is engaging in criminal activity by any other definition. These are not the only threats posed by these corporate fascists. The very same corporate digital barons have also been busy colluding with politicians in order to repeal Net Neutrality   as part of the elites  final end-run to marginalize and ultimately crush all independent and dissenting voices online who threaten the primacy of mainstream groupthink, and who could get broader traction among the population if the playing field was truly a level one. Not only is this illegal under antitrust laws, but it represents a brutal form of fascism. It s now clearer than ever that Silicon Valley executives and government bureaucrats cannot be trusted to manage the most important public utility of the new century   the information super highway.So if the mainstream press can no longer be trusted, then who can you trust for objectivity and accuracy? Again, we have to ask the question: who s watching the watchers?

Spain to take control of Catalonia if gets ambiguous reply on independence,"MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government will take control of Catalonia if  regional leader Carles Puigdemont replies ambiguously to Madrid s question about whether he has declared independence from Spain, the interior minister said on Saturday. Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid on the region s future. Spain s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia s autonomy if he chooses independence.  The answer must be without any ambiguity. He must say  yes  or  no ,  Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told Cope radio.  If he answers ambiguously, it means he doesn t want dialogue and thus the Spanish government will have to take action,  he also said. Puigdemont, who is holding consultations with local parties to prepare his answer, faces a tough dilemma. If he says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not declare it, then the far-left Catalan party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government. CUP on Friday called on Puigdemont to make an unequivocal declaration of independence in defiance of the Madrid government s deadlines. Such a hardline position has also been backed by influential pro-independence civic group Asamblea Nacional Catalana (Catalan National Assembly). They were joined on Saturday by another key member of Puigdemont s coalition, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, whose leader Oriol Junqueras said they should press ahead with splitting from Spain following an independence vote. The Catalan government said 90 percent of Catalans had voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that central authorities in Madrid had declared illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.   We have an unequivocal and absolute commitment to fulfill the democratic mandate from Oct. 1,  Junqueras said. Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the central government in Madrid can suspend the political autonomy of a region if it breaks the law.  This article, which enables Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and call a regional election, has never been activated since the constitution was adopted in 1978 after the death of dictator Francisco Franco.

Britain's May defeated in parliament over Brexit blueprint,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May s government was defeated on Wednesday, when lawmakers forced through changes to its Brexit blueprint that ministers said could endanger Britain s departure from the European Union. In a blow to May, already weakened after losing her Conservative Party s majority in a June election, the 650-seat parliament voted 309 to 305 in favor of an amendment to hand lawmakers more say over a final exit deal with the EU. Up until the last minute of an often bitter debate in parliament, May s team tried to convince lawmakers in her party to give up their demands and side with a government fearful that the move will weaken its hand in tough Brexit negotiations. Members of Parliament (MPs) are debating the EU withdrawal bill, which will repeal the 1972 legislation binding Britain to the EU and copy existing EU law into domestic law to ensure legal continuity after  Exit Day  on March 29, 2019. In focus on Wednesday was an amendment put forward by Conservative lawmaker and former attorney general Dominic Grieve who wants parliament to have a meaningful vote on any deal before it is finalised and for it to be written into law.  There is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted,  Grieve told parliament earlier, criticizing some fellow members of the Conservative Party for calling him a traitor over his decision to vote against the government. He dismissed a last-minute pledge by justice minister Dominic Raab for government to write the promise of a meaningful vote into law later on its journey through both houses of parliament as coming  too late . The government was  disappointed  by the vote, a spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that  this amendment does not prevent us from preparing our statute book for exit day . But with May due at an EU summit on Thursday to encourage the other 27 leaders to approve a move to the second phase of Brexit talks and begin a discussion about future trade, the defeat comes at a difficult time for the prime minister. In the European Parliament, which must also ratify any withdrawal treaty with Britain, its Brexit coordinator cheekily tweeted that his British counterparts had  taken back control  - a reference to the catchphrase of pro-Brexit campaigners.  A good day for democracy,  added Guy Verhofstadt. The EU withdrawal bill has been the focus of seven days of often bitter debate, underscoring the deep divisions over Brexit not only among the Conservatives but also in the main opposition Labour Party and across the country. It has also highlighted May s weakness. In June, she gambled on a snap election to strengthen her party s majority in the 650-seat parliament but instead bungled her campaign and ended up with a minority government propped up by the 10 votes of a small, pro-Brexit Northern Irish party. Since then she has struggled to assert her authority over a Conservative Party which is deeply divided over the best route out of the EU.   This defeat is a humiliating loss of authority for the government on the eve of the European Council meeting,  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement.  Theresa May has resisted democratic accountability. Her refusal to listen means she will now have to accept Parliament taking back control.  Earlier, May had tried to persuade lawmakers to vote with the government for her Brexit blueprint, saying Grieve s amendment would put added time pressure on a government which wants to make Britain ready to leave the EU in March 2019.  That could be at a very late stage in the proceedings which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have,  she told parliament before an hours-long debate on the exit plan. Her spokesman said the government had  in good faith come forward with a strong package of concessions to deal with the spirit of the amendment . Pro-Brexit lawmakers fear the amendment could force Britain to weaken its negotiating stance by offering parliament the opportunity of forcing ministers back to the negotiating table if it feels any final deal is not good enough.  Raab said that could convince the EU that Britain would not walk away from a bad deal.  Actually if that looked likely we d end up with worse terms, and we d be positively incentivizing the EU to give us worse terms,  he told parliament. ",worldnews,"December 13, 2017 ",1
Twitter to brief Congress on possible Russia-backed ads: U.S. senator,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) is expected to brief U.S. congressional investigators soon on whether Russia used its advertising platform to promote divisive social and political messages during the 2016 election, Senator Mark Warner said on Thursday.  The news came a day after Facebook (FB.O) said an operation likely based in Russia had placed thousands of U.S. ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights on the social media site during a two-year-period through May 2017. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the suspected Russian placement of such ads may have gone far beyond what Facebook disclosed, and that Twitter and other technology companies should also examine the issue.    “It was my belief that the Russians were using those sites to interfere in our elections, and the first reaction from Facebook was, ‘No. You’re crazy.’” Warner said at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance conference in Washington. “I think what we saw yesterday in terms of their brief was the tip of the iceberg,” Warner said. He also told reporters he expected Twitter to soon brief the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the panels investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether members of President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. A Warner spokeswoman later confirmed that was expected to occur.  Twitter declined to comment.  Facebook briefed U.S. lawmakers on the issue on Wednesday and also turned over information about the ads to Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is leading his own investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. That information included copies of the ads and data about the buyers, the source said. Warner said he wanted to have Facebook brief lawmakers again and that he wanted Twitter and other companies to do the same. “As you see for example in the case of Facebook, they denied that they were being used in any way. They didn’t do anything,” Warner said. “But by the time of the French elections, Facebook was working with the French” and they shut down 50,000 accounts. Warner said legislation may be required to change how social media platforms can be used for political advertising to bring federal disclosure rules in line with those governing television advertising.

" Mother Calls Cops About Her Missing 12-Year-Old, So They Come And Smash His Face In","An Idaho mother who called police after her missing 12-year-old son returned home soon regretted making the call, after cops arrived and smashed the boy s face in.On March 13, Amy Olzak called Idaho Falls Police to report her son missing. After a day-long search, a friend found the boy, and like any good citizen, Olzak called the station back to let officers know that the boy had been located and any search attempts should be called off.However, the officers came to the family home anyway. By the time they were finished, they had left her 12-year-old son with broken teeth, a possible concussion, and bruising and trauma to the neck and facial area. As Olzak explained to reporters at KIKD: I just wanted them to be aware. They came over. I talked to an officer for a minute and he walked over to my son. Then he put my son s hand behind his back and like lifted him up in the air and slammed his face into the trunk of a car. Two witnesses, the car s owner Courtney Beck, and Jessica Bowles reported seeing the whole event unfold and were both unable to give a single reason for the officer s extreme actions. Bowles said: I walked up closer and saw a chipped tooth, blood, and two fats lips. Olzak called for more officers, and they agreed that the boy needed medical attention. However, the original officer refused to release the boy from handcuffs throughout the entire visit to the hospital. He was kept in handcuffs until I took him home,  Olzak said.The family sent a tort to the Idaho Falls Police last week, in order to initiate legal proceedings against the officer for using unnecessary and excessive force against a minor. The case reminds us of the growing issue of police being called to help, only to end up killing or injuring the people they should be supporting. One of the most notable cases being the killing of 68-year-old marine veteran Kenneth Chamberlain. White Plains police officers in New York broke into his home and shot him dead after a simple call to go to his aid in a potential medical emergency   and the list is growing. It doesn t help the majority of good police, or the communities that they are meant to protect and serve, to continue making these mistakes with seeming impunity.

BRAINWASHED CHILDREN MOCK President Trump in Disturbing Washington Post VIDEO,"A disturbing video published by The Washington Post on June 29 shows a group of brainwashed students singing Twitter posts by President Donald Trump attempting to mock him.

Following their mockery of President Donald Trump, the class sings the Post s new motto:  Democracy Dies in Darkness .The Post does not state the name of the school or location where the mockery took place. The video, which was published on June 29 to the Post s verified YouTube account was also mentioned in the June 30 column, The Daily 202, titled  The Daily 202 presents the world debut of the Washington Post Kids Chorus. Their first musical assignment had a political twist: the president s tweets. From our video team: .Viewers who were disgusted in the Washington Post video made some of the following comments:  How about we leave 5-year-olds out of politics? Anything else is borderline brainwashing. Let the kids decide for themselves what their political beliefs are. No one else believes you so you have to trick children to push your narrative. This is just beyond wrong and twisted. The Left have always used children as political props. They control the schools so they have ready access. This is like North Korean propaganda.

 WATCH: BIll Maher Noticed Something Really Disturbing About Trump’s RNC Speech,"The internet went wild mocking Melania Trump this week. That is because of the fact that a large portion of the speech she gave at the Republican National Convention contained an entire section that was stolen from Michelle Obama s speech that she gave at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.As worthy as that speech was of mockery, Trump s speech was the one that was truly worthy of condemnation. Who better to do that than Bill Maher?During a monologe on Real Time, Maher lambasted the newly officiated GOP presidential candidate s speech.  Did you see Donald Trump s speech? If that had been any darker it would have been shot by the police,  Maher said.Maher went on to say that: He used the word  violence  a dozen times, the word  murder  a half-dozen times   and that was just the part about Ted Cruz. I tell you, that was a rough speech. Maher mocked the brutal imagery that Trump used during his speech. We are a shining city on a hill where we will make our last stand against the zombies. And ISIS and illegal immigrants are coming to kill us all. The use of appeals to fear in order to move people to justify violent actions are nothing new at the RNC. However, this year the speeches were particularly disturbing because they were more overt .with their bloodlust this year. They should serve as a reminder of just how dangerous Republicans are. It is more important than ever to oust the GOP from power at every level of government.

Moscow gives green light to CNN International broadcasting in Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday it had dropped accusations against CNN International of violating Russian media law and the U.S. channel could continue broadcasting in Russia. The head of broadcasting regulator Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, said the issue was resolved after CNN agreed to rectify details of its Russian license shown onscreen during broadcasts, the Interfax news agency reported. He gave no details. CNN said it did not plan to make any comment on the matter. The regulator had raised the accusations in September, a day after the Russian foreign ministry accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S operations of Kremlin-backed media outlet RT.  Zharov at the time gave no detail of the exact nature of the dispute; but he said when the accusations were raised that Russia was not motivated by any political considerations.  Claims against CNN have been dropped, the channel will continue working in Russia, but Roskomnadzor will continue monitoring the compliance of the American company s activities with Russia s legislation,  Interfax cited Zharov as saying. President Vladimir Putin told a Security Council meeting last month that Russian media outlets working abroad were facing  growing and unacceptable pressure . ",worldnews,"October 10, 2017 ",1

BEYONCE Performs Graphic Anti-Cop Song…Dancers ‘Shot’ One By One On Stage [Video],"Beyonce gets political in her graphic anti-cop performance at the MTV VMAs last night. The MTV awards use to be a fun-filled night of entertainment but now it s a chance for political activism to take center stage. Prior to the show, Beyonce met with the Michael Brown s mom and other moms of people killed by police officers. We guess she forgot about the fact that all of these cases are legitimate cases of crimes being committed by the deceased. The truth is way too buried because it s more profitable for the truth to be twisted. Where were the families of police officers like the Dallas officers murdered in cold blood? Nope, Beyonce had to stick with a lie and be the political activist she always has been. Remember the Super Bowl? Yes, that was where she had her dancers form an X on the field in support of the Black Panthers fist raised in the air and all. I have one thing to say about all of this  While performing a medley of songs from her hit album, Lemonade, the pop megastar was surrounded by backup dancers dressed as angels. However, as red lights flooded the stage, each of the  angels  was shot down during the performance, which viewers said was a representation of police brutality. The imagery of the Beyonce performance with the angels getting shot down ,  one person tweeted.  Beyonce too deep.

 Bill Maher Hilariously Rips Donald Trump’s Unemployment Lie To Shreds (VIDEO),"On Friday, during a segment of Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedic host utterly destroyed Donald Trump s latest round of lies. The most notable example of Trump s no f#cks given, blatant lying relates to unemployment. Trump has stated multiple times that he has  heard  that the unemployment rate is really somewhere around 40 percent. Trump s continued use of the bogus talking point, has recently garnered new attention.Politifact gave Trump a  Pants on Fire  rating when he made the claim during a televised press conference back in September. It is just one among his total of the 18  Pants on Fire  ratings that Trump has received from them. During the press conference, Trump said: The number isn t reflective. I ve seen numbers of 24 percent   I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent. 5.3 percent unemployment   that is the biggest joke there is in this country.   The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it s a 30, 32. And the highest I ve heard so far is 42 percent. Maher marveled at how ridiculous the claim is. Maher pondered what exactly an America with a 40% unemployment would look like. He mentions the horrific realities of the life during the Great Depression. During that dark time in the United States economic history, the unemployment rate was at its highest was 25 percent. Almost half of Trump s claim. Maher asks: Do you have any idea what America would look like with 40 percent unemployment? In the Great Depression, people were jumping out of windows and selling apples on the street. Maher laid part of the blame for Trump and other Republican s ability to get away with making such bold and obvious lies, with the media. He points out the lack of outrage in the media over the Supreme Court s decision earlier this week to block most of President Obama s new carbon emission rules, as an example.You can watch the segment below, in full.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXVhR5rC7rg Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube ",News,"February 13, 2016",0
TOP TEN Most “Ethically Challenged” Clinton E-mails,"The party s over or is it? Hillary Clinton and her aides will need to decide whether to lie or tell the truth to the FBI about her e-mail and official business. This puts them in a position of choosing between being honest about those emails, or lying to the FBI, which is a crime,  said Matthew G. Whitaker, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004 to 2009. He is presently executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) in Washington, D.C.Federal agents are preparing to schedule interviews with Clinton s  longtime and closest aides  about her use of the private email and server throughout her tenure as the nation s chief diplomat from 2009 to 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.Despite Clinton s repeated denial she ever sent or received classified information via her private email, federal investigators said more than 2,000 of the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the Department of State did include classified material. More than 20 of those emails contained information so sensitive and classified members of Congress were not allowed to read them.Whitaker s group made public its list of what it judges to be the  top 10 most ethically challenged Hillary emails  March 10, 2016:Nepotism: Clinton intervened Aug. 22, 2012, on behalf of her son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky, in an effort to secure State Department assistance for one of his business associates with ties to a Clinton Foundation donor. FACT filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on this issue. Favoring Insiders: Clinton  impressed  billionaire donor George Soros with his easy access to her, according to a May 12, 2012, email to her from Neera Tanden, veteran Clinton adviser and president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress. Above The Law: Clinton told aide Jake Sullivan in a June 17, 2011, email to disregard classification security regulations and send information for a speech via a non-secure email system, which forced the aide to either break the law or disobey an order. Special Interests: In a July 26, 2010, email exchange with Clinton, Sullivan forwarded a message from Jeffrey Farrow, an influential lobbyist for a Pacific island government. The exchange  raises red flags about whether Farrow had made  requests,  according to FACT. Selling Access: A Dec. 10, 2009, email discussed attempts by Clinton campaign and foundation donor Brian Greenspun to set up a meeting between Clinton and a top Israeli official who had  been trying to meet with [Clinton] to no avail.  The email suggests certain campaign and foundation donors had a privileged  back door  to Clinton. Conflicts Of Interest: Clinton pushed for the State Department to work with the Clinton Foundation and the Red Cross on a project in Haiti. The Jan. 19, 2010, email from Clinton to Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills indicates a clear conflict of interest, according to FACT. Helping Political Allies: Mark Penn, Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign pollster and long-time political adviser, complained about not having timely access on a corporate event in China. His complaints were apparently resolved after a Feb. 22, 2010, email from Clinton aide Kris Balderston that set up a telephone call with Clinton. Trading Favors: Barely a week after the Penn complaint, Balderston reported in a March 2 email to Clinton that major corporations, including Boeing, CITI and Blackstone, agreed to provide financial support for the event.  Even the appearance of this sort of favor trading, involving the public, private and political sectors, is a bad ethics practice,  according to FACT. Abuse Of Position: A Sept. 15, 2011, email forwarded to Clinton, Sullivan and aide Huma Abedin listed multiple State Department officials attending the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative conference despite having  no official role.  Robert Hormats, a department official, was also a speaker at a dinner co-hosted by the Goldman Sachs Wall Street investment firm that later paid Clinton $675,000 for three speeches. The dinner focused on investing in women, Clinton s favorite Clinton Foundation project. Duping Obama: In a Sept. 20, 2011, email to Clinton, Mills forwarded a draft of President Barack Obama s planned remarks to the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative. FACT contends that  Clinton doesn t appear to have routinely received copies of the President s draft speeches, and it sends bad ethical signals to treat a speech given to her family s organization differently.

 Track Palin Faces Assault And Weapons Charges After Domestic Violence Report,"It s no secret that the Palin family are fans of drunken hijinks after a well-publicized drunken birthday brawl in 2014. Shortly after it became news that Sarah can see a Donald Trump presidency from her house, more news surfaced   something regarding one of her children. No, it has nothing to do with Bristol for once. According to Gawker, Track Palin, who reportedly broke his ribs during the aforementioned drunken brawl, faces weapons and assault charges after he drunkenly interfered with a report of domestic violence.According to online records, Track was charged on Sunday with assault, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.It is unclear who was filing the domestic violence report when the armed and drunk Palin got violent with an unnamed female, but we can be certain more details will surface. For now, Wasilla police said in a statement: An investigation revealed Track Palin had committed a domestic violence assault on a female, interfered with her ability to report a crime of domestic violence, and possessed a firearm while intoxicated. Palin s ex-wife, Britta Hanson, says she was not involved in the incident. The unidentified victim was found with  bruising and swelling around her left eye  and complained of pain in her right knee.At one point, Track was   holding onto a gun, yelling  do you think I m a p y?  and  do you think I won t do it?  apparently threatening to kill himself. [The woman] was concerned he would shoot himself and ran outside and around the house,  according to reports. She ultimately hid under a bed.On Tuesday, Sarah Palin announced that she is endorsing Donald Trump for President.  I am greatly honored to receive Sarah s endorsement,  Trump said in a statement following Palin s decision to endorse him.  She is a friend, and a high-quality person whom I have great respect for. I am proud to have her support.  Fortunately for Palin, Trump likely won t care about something like a little domestic violence, given his own track record.Palin was held without bail until his arraignment on Tuesday, police say.It s so nice to see  family values  people show exactly who they really are. Unfortunately, this will do nothing to change how conservatives feel about the Palins, their opinions, or even about those who eagerly gobble up their endorsements. They believe in Jesus, after all, and that s enough to convince most conservatives to look past quite literally anything.Featured image via People ",News,"January 19, 2016",0
White House says Flynn's Russia plea implicates Flynn alone,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The guilty plea entered by former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn to a charge of lying to the FBI implicates Flynn alone, the White House said in a statement on Friday. “Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,” said Ty Cobb, a White House attorney. “The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,” Cobb said, adding that the plea “clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion” of the Office of the Special Counsel’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion by Trump’s campaign.

Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 22 at 6:30 P.M. EDT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Wednesday: The Republican chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee says some of Trump’s personal communications may have been caught up in “incidental” surveillance involving a foreign power in the months after the election. The main investigative panel of the House of Representatives has asked the White House and the FBI for documents regarding former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s foreign contacts with Russia, Turkey and others, its Republican chairman and Democratic counterpart say. Trump and Republican congressional leaders appear to be losing the battle to gather enough support in the House of Representatives to pass their Obamacare rollback bill, watched by wary investors in financial markets. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking at a meeting of countries fighting Islamic State, says the United States will set up “interim zones of stability” to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda. U.S.-led coalition aircraft drops fighters for the first time into an area near the Syrian city of Raqqa to retake territory from Islamic State in a mission that includes artillery and special operations troops. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch says presidents must obey court orders and expresses uncertainty about language in the Constitution barring U.S. government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as Democrats grill him on issues involving Trump. Labor Secretary nominee R. Alexander Acosta tells a Senate committee he will abide by Trump’s directive to review a pending “fiduciary rule” for retirement investment advisers, indicating he believed it goes too far. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will meet with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss the administration’s proposed budget, the panel’s chairman says, after heated opposition in Congress to Trump’s plan to slash funding for diplomacy and foreign aid.

U.S. defense chief urges Pakistan to redouble efforts against militants,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met Pakistan’s civilian and military leaders on Monday and urged them to “redouble” their efforts to rein in militants accused of using the country as a base to carry out attacks in neighboring Afghanistan. Mattis, on a one-day visit to Pakistan, said the South Asian nation had made progress in the fight against militancy inside its borders but needed to make more. More than 100 days since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a South Asia strategy that calls for a firmer line toward Islamabad, U.S. officials and analysts say there has been only limited success and it is not clear how progress will be made. U.S. officials have long been frustrated by what they see as Pakistan’s reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on Pakistani soil to launch attacks in Afghanistan. “The Secretary reiterated that Pakistan must redouble its efforts to confront militants and terrorists operating within the country,” the Pentagon said in a statement. Mattis, who visited Pakistan for the first time as defense secretary, said before the trip that the goal for his meetings with Pakistani officials would be to find “common ground”. In his discussion with Mattis, Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the two allies shared objectives. “We’re committed (to) the war against terror,” he said. “Nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan.” Mattis also met with high-ranking officials from Pakistan’s powerful military, including army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Lieutenant-General Naveed Mukhtar, the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency that U.S. officials say has links with Haqqani and Taliban militants. A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mattis’ conversations had been “straightforward” and specific. The official said one of the topics of conversation was getting Pakistan to help bring the Taliban to the negotiating table   In August, Trump outlined a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, chastising Pakistan over its alleged support for Afghan militants. But beyond that, the Trump administration has done little to articulate its strategy, experts say.  U.S. officials say they have not seen a change in Pakistan’s support for militants, despite visits by senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. “We have been very direct and very clear with the Pakistanis ... we have not seen those changes implemented yet,” General John Nicholson, the top U.S. general in Afghanistan, said last week. Pakistani officials have pushed back on the U.S. accusations and say they have done a great deal to help the United States in tracking down militants. U.S. official expressed hope relations could improve after a U.S.-Canadian couple kidnapped in Afghanistan were freed in Pakistan in October with their three children. While the Trump administration has used tougher words with Pakistan, it is has yet to change Islamabad’s calculus. Some experts say the United States loses clout in Pakistan when it is seen as bullying. While Mattis traveled to the region earlier this year, he did not stop in Pakistan, but visited its arch rival, India, a relationship that has grown under the Trump administration.  “There is not an effective stick anymore because Pakistan doesn’t really care about U.S aid, it has been dwindling anyway and it is getting the money it needs elsewhere ... treat it with respect and actually reward it when it does do something good,” said Madiha Afzal, with the Brookings Institution. Mattis’ brief visit to Islamabad comes a week after a hardline Pakistani Islamist group called off nationwide protests after the government met its demand that a minister accused of blasphemy resign. Separately, a Pakistani Islamist accused of masterminding a bloody 2008 assault in the Indian city of Mumbai was freed from house arrest. The White House said the release could have repercussions for U.S.-Pakistan relations. “I think for Pakistan, the timing is very bad. There is talk about progress being made against extremists and here you have a situation where religious hardliners have basically been handed everything they wanted on a silver platter,” said Michael Kugelman, with the Woodrow Wilson think tank in Washington.

U.S. House Freedom Caucus wants tax reform plan before budget deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The conservative House Freedom Caucus threatened on Wednesday to block a fiscal 2018 budget resolution vital to tax reform, unless Republican leaders release a plan that slashes U.S. corporate taxes and doubles the standard deduction for individuals.    The demand from the hardline group could escalate infighting that has prevented Republicans in the House of Representatives from agreeing on a spending blueprint for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. With about three dozen members, the Freedom Caucus can stymie any legislation in the Republican-controlled House.  Passing a budget resolution is vital to the success of a  Republican tax overhaul effort because it would allow a bill to pass the 100-seat Senate with only a simple majority. Otherwise, the legislation would require 60 votes in a chamber where Republicans have only 52 seats. The Freedom Caucus also repeated a call for the House to remain in session during August, saying lawmakers should also address healthcare and an increase in the federal debt ceiling rather than head home to their districts. Budget negotiations have bogged down over the group’s efforts to include more than $200 billion of cuts to mandatory spending programs over a decade in any budget resolution, a move opposed by Republican moderates.  President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have promised to deliver a tax reform package this year. But the House budget squabble and hurdles facing healthcare legislation in the Senate have begun to worry business lobbyists about the prospects for success. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter on Wednesday to Senate Republicans calling for tax cuts and other policy changes it said would make businesses more competitive at home and abroad.   “If a budget is put forth today, at $200 billion in mandatory spending and without decisions on tax reform, there would not be enough votes to pass it in the House,” the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, told a news conference. In comments that paralleled a White House plan released in April, Meadows said tax reform should set a 16 percent corporate tax rate and double the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemize. Trump has called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate, versus the current 35 percent rate.  Freedom Caucus members also want House Republican leaders to abandon an unpopular border adjustment proposal that would tax imports.   Top Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress are trying to agree on a framework for tax reform, and the White House has said a plan could be set by the end of July. But there have been no tangible signs of progress in the closed-door discussions, while lobbyists and some congressional aides say the end-of-July deadline could be too ambitious.

Kushner Cos says to skip China marketing push this weekend,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The company owned by the family of senior White House aide Jared Kushner will skip roadshow events in China this weekend seeking money from local investors for a real estate project in exchange for a shot at U.S. immigrant visas, a company spokesman said. Nicole Kushner Meyer, Jared’s sister, appeared at marketing events last weekend in Beijing and Shanghai in an effort to raise $150 million from Chinese investors through the controversial EB-5 visa-for-investment program. According to marketing materials from one of the organizers of the roadshow, sales events for the project are scheduled in the southern cities of Shenzhen on Saturday and Guangzhou on Sunday. “No one from Kushner Companies will be in China this weekend,” James Yolles, spokesman for the firm, said. The company and KABR Group are raising money for a two-tower apartment complex in New Jersey called One Journal Square, marketing materials showed. Kushner Companies earlier this week apologized for Meyer having mentioned Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, in discussing the project. The company said Meyer had done so only in an attempt to make clear that her brother was not involved. “Kushner Companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms. Meyer’s intention,” it said. In addition to Meyer, Laurent Morali, president of Kushner Companies, was included in marketing materials online for the China road show. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year. The EB-5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy U.S. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. A member of the audience at the marketing event in Shanghai said Meyer spoke for about 10 minutes during last Sunday’s event and described her family’s humble roots. According to the New York Times, in Beijing on Saturday she told the audience of about 100 people the project “means a lot to me and my entire family”. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2017 ",1
Democrats say gun defeat in Congress could help on campaign trail,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress ended a 25-hour sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives where they have been countless times before: short of the votes needed to tighten U.S. gun laws. But many see their latest defeat as a prelude to victory in the Nov. 8 elections. Spurred by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Democrats are showing a new willingness to make gun laws a top issue in Washington and on the campaign trail, defying powerful lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association that have helped make the United States the most gun-friendly country in the developed world. The effort is not likely to change federal firearms laws this year, as Republicans who control Congress have shown little interest in proposals that they say weaken Americans’ constitutional right to bear arms. But Democrats and their allies say that defeat now on Capitol Hill could help them win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections. That is a shift from previous elections when Democrats have downplayed the issue on the campaign trail. “The tide has turned, and Republicans ignore this issue at their own peril,” said Robert Weiner, a former Democratic congressional aide.  Hillary Clinton, the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, talks frequently in her campaign about banning military-style assault rifles and expanding background checks — a marked contrast to President Barack Obama, who avoided talk of guns during his 2008 and 2012 elections. In Congress, Democrats have resorted to confrontational tactics to force gun votes since June 12, when a gunman killed 49 people at a Florida nightclub. Senator Chris Murphy’s 15-hour speech in the Senate last week forced five votes this week on measures that would make it harder for terrorism suspects to buy guns, though none have advanced. In the House, Democrats occupied the chamber for 25 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to force votes on terrorism suspects and expanding background checks for gun buyers. Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway said Democrats’ willingness to talk about guns reflects the party becoming more liberal, not a change in public sentiment.  Most voters view the shooting in Orlando as an act of terrorism inspired by Islamic State, she said. “The shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, he did not call 911 and pledge allegiance to Smith & Wesson,” she said, referring to an acronym for Islamic State and the firearms manufacturer. Still, Democrats’ willingness to take a stand on gun control has shifted the debate, said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. “There’s a potentially a good electoral outcome for Democrats out of this. They will probably pick up seats,” he said. After landslide defeats in 2010 and 2014, most Democrats who remain in office tend to represent safely liberal congressional districts where gun control is popular. But those up for election in competitive states have spoken up as well. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who hopes to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio in gun-friendly Florida, said during the House sit-in that gun rights groups like the NRA are “largely responsible” for the country’s 32,000 annual gun deaths.  “This passion you’re seeing is what’s needed to get people to wake up,” he said on the House floor. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats have public opinion on their side: a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted this week found that 48 percent of those surveyed support strong gun regulations, while 23 percent support minimal rules. Support runs higher for specific proposals, like imposing background checks on all gun buyers. (bit.ly/28U7CA7) But intensity has been a sticking point for gun control advocates. The NRA has been able to mobilize supporters who are willing to vote for or against a candidate solely because of their position on guns, while gun-control supporters typically consider other issues as well, such as abortion and the environment. “Anytime the Democrats start a gun movement, it costs them votes,” said Dave “Mudcat” Saunders, who has worked for centrist Democratic candidates. “I can’t imagine it’s changing.” Shootings in Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and, most recently, Orlando have changed that dynamic, others say.  “Mass shootings are highly visible, and force people to pay attention and realize that we have a problem that isn’t going to be solved by more guns,” said Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist in Atlanta who worked on Obama’s 2012 campaign. The gun-control lobbying group Everytown for Gun Safety says its members generated 245,000 telephone calls to Congress, and brought hundreds of its members to Congress to press for action during the debate. “I’ve been in the fight for a number of years and I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Colin Goddard, an advocate with the group who was wounded during the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting.

Erdogan and Macron to urge U.S. to turn back on Jerusalem decision: sources,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey s Tayyip Erdogan and France s Emmanuel Macron will work together to try to persuade the United States to reconsider its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a Turkish presidential source said on Saturday. The two leaders agreed during a phone call that the move is worrisome for the region, the source said, adding that Turkey and France would make a joint effort to try to reverse the U.S. decision. Erdogan also spoke on the phone to the presidents of Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Azerbaijan on Saturday regarding the issue, the source said. On Wednesday, he called an urgent meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Turkey next week. President Donald Trump s announcement on Wednesday has upset U.S. allies in the West. At the United Nations, France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Sweden called on the United States to  bring forward detailed proposals for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement . Palestinians took to the streets following the U.S. decision. Demonstrations also took place in Iran, Jordan, Tunisia, Somalia, Yemen, Malaysia and Indonesia, and outside the U.S. embassy in Berlin. The status of Jerusalem has been one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians for generations. France has been a supporter of the Palestinian cause. In 2014, the French National Assembly passed a non-binding motion calling on the government to recognize Palestine, but the government has not officially done so.  Paris has pointed out in the past its conviction that a two-state solution requires the recognition of Palestine. ",worldnews,"December 9, 2017 ",1
LOL! ANTI-TRUMP ACTORS George Clooney and Matt Damon’s “Suburbicon” Movie TANKS: “One of Paramount Pictures’ worst performing wide-releases ever”,"In fly-over country, and pretty much anywhere in between the east and west coasts of America, people are sick and tired supporting the arrogant, condescending, anti-American, Trump hating,  liberal actors  and Hollywood is finally starting to feel the pain in their pocketbooks. George Clooney s  Suburbicon  notched one of the most dismal wide-release debuts in recent years on a sluggish pre-Halloween weekend where the horror sequel  Jigsaw  topped all releases despite an underperforming debut.Despite debuting on more than 2,000 screens,  Suburbicon  managed just $2.8 million, making it one of Paramount Pictures  worst performing wide-releases ever and marking a new box-office low for Clooney as a director and star Matt Damon. Obviously we are disappointed in these results which we don t feel are indicative of the quality and message of his original movie,  said Kyle Davies, president of distribution for Paramount. liberal activist actors Matt Damon, George Clooney and Julianne MooreAre liberal activist actors Matt Damon, George Clooney and Julianne Moore so blinded by their hate for middle America, that they can t see the audience they re trying to appeal to, has lost their desire to support them and their sub-par movies?Before the election last year, Matt Damon expressed his anxiety over a possible Trump win:  It makes me nervous,  Damon said of the possibility that Trump would win the presidency (which he did via the Electoral College).  It s a binary choice . There s no way we can let this guy be the [president]. To let that dude have the nuclear football, are you kidding me? That s dangerous. He s impulsive and rash, and doesn t seem to think deeply about too many things. Who can forget George Clooney s interview, where he laughed at the idea that Trump would win the election, saying  There s not gonna be a President Donald Trump. That s not gonna happen. Co-star Julianne Moore is no stranger to the Hollywood anti-Trump movement.  The outspoken gun-control advocate shared her thoughts with the Huffington Post on Trump s  nationalistic  rhetoric more specifically. It s a very interesting time,  she said.

"U.S. expels 15 Cuban diplomats, fuelling tensions with Havana","WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Cuba’s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana from a mysterious spate of health “attacks,” spurring new tensions between the former Cold War foes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the expulsions from Cuba’s embassy in Washington were also intended to ensure “equity” in staffing levels, after he recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana on Friday. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the decision as “unjustified,” accused the United States of insufficient cooperation with Cuba’s investigation of the health incidents and urged Washington to stop politicizing the matter. The steps taken by Republican President Donald Trump’s administration delivers another blow to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of rapprochement, including actions likely to erode the normalization of a relationship dominated for decades by mutual hostility and suspicion. The latest U.S. move was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave, a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Until the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,” Tillerson said in a statement. “We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,” he added. The United States announced on Friday that it was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit the Communist-ruled island because of the alleged attacks it says have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in 22 U.S. embassy personnel. The State Department had said the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. Cuba has denied involvement in any attacks and says it has reinforced security for U.S. diplomatic personnel. Rodriguez said lack of U.S. cooperation had stymied its own investigation into the matter. Authorities had not provided access to the injured people and the doctors who examined them, or to the homes where the attacks allegedly took place, he said, adding that evidence had been delivered late.  Rodriguez urged the United States to cooperate more and said Cuba was also working with Canada on the investigation as Canadian diplomats have reported similar symptoms. So far, none of the probes have yielded any answers about how the alleged attacks were carried out or who was responsible. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be kicked out in retaliation for the Cuban government’s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks. “I commend the U.S. State Department for expelling a number of Cuban operatives from the U.S.,” Rubio, an influential voice on Trump’s Cuba policy, said in a statement. But James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based pro-engagement lobbying group said: “This decision appears to be purely political, driven by the desire of a handful of individuals in Congress to halt progress between our two countries.” “It looks like we are returning the threats and tensions of the 1960s,” said Maria Fernandez, a 45-year-old office worker in Havana. “This is madness by Trump. It’s really sad, because we are so close, and yet so far away from a sincere rapprochement.” Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama after five decades of hostility, called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations last month. Cuba described his comments as “unacceptable and meddling.” Rodriguez urged the United States “not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and could rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations.” In Havana, U.S. diplomats frantically selling off their belongings at garage sales and on social media, said they were disappointed to be ordered to leave. In a message on Facebook, the embassy’s top official, career diplomat Scott Hamilton, said he would also be leaving. “I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,” he wrote. “Hasta la proxima Cuba.” ",politicsNews,"October 3, 2017 ",1

Mnuchin says U.S. growth prospects not fully reflected in markets,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that he believes financial markets could improve “significantly” once they fully reflect the potential for U.S. economic growth from President Donald Trump’s economic policies. Mnuchin said at an event sponsored by news website Axios that optimism about U.S. growth from policies such as regulatory reform and tax reform is “definitely not all baked in” to market valuations. U.S. stock prices and the dollar have strengthened significantly since Trump was elected in November, largely in anticipation of corporate profits rising as regulatory burdens ease and tax rates fall. Some of those gains were retraced this week as Republicans in Congress faced stiff opposition from conservatives in passing a bill to replace the Obamacare health law. “I think there is some good news that’s baked in, but yet, I think there is further room for significant growth in the economy that would be reflected in the markets,” Mnuchin said. “The consequence would be that the market could go up significantly,” Mnuchin added. Treasury secretaries in the past have shied away from publicly discussing market valuations. But Mnuchin said Trump’s policies could produce growth of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, which is significantly higher than the fourth quarter reading of 1.9 percent.  “We’re in an environment where the U.S. assets are the most attractive assets to invest in on a global basis.” Mnuchin said he is still aiming to achieve passage of comprehensive tax reform by the time Congress takes its August recess. He also said he expects the Trump administration’s Obamacare replacement bill to pass later on Friday. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2017 ",1

"FATHER OF SON MURDERED BY ILLEGAL ALIEN: Donald Trump Was “Sent from God”…”Since my son was dead, I pretty much gave up on being happy” [VIDEO]","This former Democrat is speaking out about the only man who cared enough to reach out to him after the random murder of his innocent son by an illegal alien. The Left will be calling him  Uncle Tom  in 5 4 3 2 1 A new ad released Friday by Donald Trump s campaign team tells the story of Jamiel Shaw, a Los Angeles man who lost his teenage son in 2008 when a man in the U.S. illegally randomly shot and killed 17-year-old Jas.WATCH AD HERE:I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016https://t.co/wd3LlMz01I  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2016In his first interview since the ad debuted, Shaw, an African-American man, told the Washington Examiner why he chose to support the Republican Manhattan billionaire who has been criticized by some as a racist and a phony.It started on March 2, 2008, in the Arlington Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles were Jas had been walking home, talking with his girlfriend on a cellphone. He was three doors down from his house when a car pulled up by him. Two Hispanic men in the vehicle asked Jas which gang he belonged to. Police reports indicate Jas did not respond, which frustrated one of the men who pulled out a gun and shot the teen.Jamiel, inside the family home, heard the shots and ran outside to find his son, a boy he judged to have been on the  right path,  bleeding from bullet wounds. Jas later died at the hospital.In the days that followed that incident, Shaw tried to piece together the perfect storm of conditions that created this tragedy. Shaw learned the man who had killed his son was an illegal immigrant who had just been released from jail.The incident gained national attention for a short time, prompting former president George W. Bush to write a condolence letter. But it was quickly forgotten, and Shaw didn t quite know what to do. Since my son was dead, I pretty much gave up on being happy,  Shaw said. He said he gave in to grieving day in and day out. Shaw also admitted a frustration of not being able to express the sorrow he had to others.Trump unexpectedly reached out to Shaw last year about the murder and asked for a meeting at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles hotel, which left Shaw stunned. To see somebody, especially a billionaire, come out. I can t even get a neighborhood politician to come out, that s why it s so surreal to me,  Shaw said.The two shared an intimate moment shortly after meeting last year.  He told me to my face, he said,  I promise you I would never let your son s life be in vain.  To me it felt like the [future] president cared about me,  an emotional Shaw shared.Shaw told the Washington Examiner that he never reached out to the Trump campaign about immigration policy, and especially the deportation of violent criminals of the kind who killed his son. He believes someone on Trump s team saw an interview he did on Fox News.Trump s meeting with Shaw and promise to reform immigration laws were a transformative moment for Shaw, who was previously a Democrat but had switched to Independent following the death of his son.

Catalonia's leaders fight off direct rule from Madrid,"MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s leaders said on Saturday they would not accept direct rule imposed on the region by the Spanish government, as a political crisis that has rattled the economy and raised fears of prolonged unrest showed no signs of easing. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced earlier on Saturday he would invoke special constitutional powers to fire the regional government and force a new election to counter the region s move towards independence. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10 after a referendum to secede, called Rajoy s moves the  worst attacks against the people of Catalonia  since Spain s military dictatorship. It is the first time since Spain s return to democracy that the central government has used its powers to seize control of a regional administration.  Rajoy said it was necessary to end a crisis that has fractured the country and prompted Spain to reduce growth forecasts for the euro zone s fourth-largest economy. After taking party in peaceful demonstration, Puigdemont expressed his rejection of Madrid s move, but stopped short of saying he would make good his threat to push ahead with the independence bid before direct rule takes effect.  I ask the (Catalan) parliament to meet in a plenary session during which we, the representatives of the citizens  sovereignty, will be able to decide over this attempt to liquidate our government and our democracy, and act in consequence,  Puigdemont said in a televised address. Rajoy, who acted with backing from the main opposition party in Madrid and King Felipe, needs the authorization of Spain s upper house of parliament to impose direct rule.  Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,  he said. The Senate vote that would give Madrid full control of Catalonia s finances, police and public media and curb the powers of the regional parliament for up to six months is scheduled for next Friday. That could give the independence movement room to maneuver. The regional parliament s speaker, Carme Forcadell, said she would not accept Madrid s move and accused Rajoy of a  coup.   Prime Minister Rajoy wants the parliament of Catalonia to stop being a democratic parliament, and we will not allow this to happen,  Forcadell said in a televised speech. The assembly is expected to decide on Monday whether to hold a session to formally proclaim the republic of Catalonia. Catalan media have said Puigdemont could dissolve the regional parliament and call elections by next Friday. Under Catalan law, those elections would take place within two months. That would enable Puigdemont to go the polls earlier than envisaged by Rajoy, who spoke of a six-month timetable, and to exploit the anti-Madrid sentiment running high in the region.     Pro-independence groups have previously mustered more than 1 million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid s refusal to negotiate a solution. Puigdemont and his cabinet colleagues joined a demonstration in Barcelona, wearing yellow ribbons in support of two senior independence campaigners who have been jailed on charges of sedition.  Freedom! Freedom!  tens of thousands of protesters chanted as they waived independence flags and signs reading  Defending our land is not a crime,  and  Let s proclaim the republic.   (Rajoy) triggering this article will not resolve anything,  said 38-year-old builder Abel Fernandez, attending the demonstration with a pro-independence flag tied around his neck.  They won t be able to keep quiet the half of Catalonia that is in favor of independence and those who favor the right to decide.      Catalan authorities said about 90 percent of those who took part in the referendum on Oct. 1 voted for independence. But only 43 percent of the electorate participated, with most opponents of secession staying at home. The independence push has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain and divided Catalonia itself. It has also prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters out of the region. Rajoy on Saturday urged them to stay. His center-right People s Party (PP) government has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence. It received unequivocal backing from the opposition Socialist Party.  Differences with the PP on our territorial unity? None!  said Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez. Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the referendum were condemned by human rights groups, and secessionists accused Madrid of taking  political prisoners . ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1

Company protests were also expected in Washington D.C., New York and California.Trump s new policy seeks to exclude people who:do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law   those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including  honor  killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.Trump underlined the pro-American nature of his reform today, saying at the National Prayer Breakfast that;Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world. But there are those who would exploit that generosity and undermine the values that we hold so dear. We need security. There are those who would seek to enter our country  to spread violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith.We will not allow  intolerance to spread in our nation  So in the coming days we will develop a system to make sure those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination.

" Trump Campaign Manager Busted In Another HUGE Lie, Worked For A Decade To ‘Benefit Putin Government’ (DETAILS)","More information about Donald Trump s Russian ties keeps coming out and now another shoe has dropped. According to the Associated Press, Paul Manafort, who served as Trump s campaign manager in 2016, spent about ten years working to  benefit  Vladimir Putin. His job? To make Putin not look like a murderous dictator.The AP reports:Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work.Trump, his administration, and Manafort himself have spent months downplaying his involvement with Russia, even after he left the campaign because of his Russian ties. But it turns out that Manafort was apparently far closer to Putin than he ever let on.In a memo to Deripaska in 2005, Manafort wrote that we are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.  The effort, he explained, will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government. Manafort responded with a statement that said his dealings with Deripaska are being unfairly painted as  inappropriate or nefarious  and insists this is all just part of a massive  smear campaign. I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments,  Manafort said.  My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests. This latest disclosure comes after FBI Director James Comey confirmed on Monday that the bureau is investigating not just Russia s interference in the U.S. election, but also the possibility that Trump colluded with them to sway the election.You can watch more on this story here, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 22, 2017",0
Thousands of Romanians mourn former king Michael,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Thousands of Romanians lined the streets of Bucharest on Saturday for the funeral of the country s former king Michael, one of the last surviving World War Two European heads of state. Born in 1921, Michael ruled Romania twice, switched its alliance away from Nazi Germany to the Allied side during the war and was subsequently forced into exile by a Communist takeover in 1947. He died in Switzerland on Dec. 5 at the age of 96, having retired from public life due to severe illness in 2016. On Saturday, Bucharest churches rang their bells and mourners, many in tears, threw white flowers at the funeral procession, chanting  King Michael  and  Down with communism . European royalty attended, including Spain s former king, Juan Carlos, Britain s Prince Charles, King Carl Gustaf of Sweden and his wife Queen Silvia. Even though the restoration of the monarchy is not an issue in the European Union state, Michael commanded great respect from Romanians who saw him in sharp opposition to a political class which they link with poverty and corruption.   His death comes at a time of deep divisions in Romanian society. Massive street protests against attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to weaken the fight against corruption and the rule of law have taken place on and off throughout 2017. Earlier this month, the Social Democrats used their solid majority to approve a judicial overhaul in the lower house that threatens to put the justice system under political control. On Monday, lawmakers begin debating changes to the criminal code that critics say will derail law and order. A descendant of the German Hohenzollern dynasty and a cousin of Britain s Queen Elizabeth, Michael was in his early twenties when he participated in a 1944 coup that overthrew fascist leader Marshal Ion Antonescu.  Romania then broke with Nazi Germany and switched to the Allied side. Historians have said his actions might have shortened the war and saved thousands of lives. After communism collapsed, politicians fearing Michael s influence blocked his first few attempted visits after decades of exile in Switzerland, Britain and the United States. He finally returned to Romania in 1992 and regained citizenship in 1997. With his passing, the Romanian royal family s relevance will likely fade, since his children have little public standing. Princess Margareta, his eldest daughter, remains custodian of the crown. ",worldnews,"December 16, 2017 ",1
BURN! NYT TAKES JAB AT FOX NEWS…Watch How FOX Got Even in a Big Way! [Video],"Sometimes, the left just makes it far too easy to win.It is a well-known fact that President Trump is a big fan of FNC s  FOX & Friends,  tweeting about it often. New York Times  James Poniewozik recently ran a hit piece criticizing the show for its friendly relationship with the president, stating that  President Trump is the show s subject, its programmer, its publicist and its virtual fourth host. The stars offer him flattery, encouragement and advice. While furthering his point, Poniewozik complimented the morning show by calling it the most powerful TV show in America  due to Trump s support. Instead of getting mad, FNC got even. They purchased ads in the New Yorks Times featuring its own accidental compliment. A Fox News source confirmed that the advertisement was in direct response to the article. But the sweet revenge didn t end there. After hearing about FNC s clever move in response to Poniewozik s piece, President Trump tweeted his own jab at the New York Times:Wow, the Failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends  .the most powerful T.V. show in America.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2017 FOX & Friends  host Steve Doocy held up the ad on air to share the victory with viewers. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt gave the show s viewers all the credit, saying  we have the best viewers. You guys are so awesome. Long-time host Brian Kilmeade joked that it must have been tough for the Times to admit the success of the show before stating the ad was also featured in the New York Post.Looks like Trump isn t the only one in town who can go head to head with the liberal media and come out on top.Read more: Biz Pac Review",politics,"Jul 29, 2017",0
 The Three Things The Oregon ‘Patriots’ REALLY Want That Nobody Is Talking About (VIDEO),"As soon as the news spread that there was some kind of a  takeover  of federal land combined with the name  Bundy,  ears across America perked up. However, this isn t Cliven Bundy himself but rather his son Ammon, who is just as stubborn   and since everyone seems to have missed it   extremely greedy.Greedy like his Daddy. In 2014, Cliven decided his cattle should get to graze for free and that the more than million dollars in fees he owed the US taxpayer was  tyranny.  Armed freaks from across the country showed up when BLM agents seized Bundy s cattle and pointed assault rifles at them until the cattle were returned and Bundy was left alone.The federal government allowed the cattle to be returned, but Bundy is far from out of the woods.Now son Ammon has started his very own revolution, breaking into a federal building located on a wildlife refuge in Oregon, a federally protected plot of land with the strictest of rules as far as fires, hunting, alcohol and stupidity go, four things the  patriots  who have moved in will certainly partake in.The episode started when a local rancher and his son were sentenced to federal prison for setting over 100 acres of public land on fire to cover up their poaching. After a protest of their incarceration, Bundy and company took the piece of forest and released a video recruiting more  Murikans, promising them food and a place to stay. Just bring your guns.At the beginning of that video, Bundy lays out three goals for the area, highlighting the kind of person he actually is. Bundy clearly says he s going to  protect  the people and bring back the ranchers, miners and loggers:When you cast aside all of the  I love my country  BS and the  we re here for the people  garbage, you ll see that Bundy and pals targeted a wildlife management area because the things they think they re going to start doing there are strictly forbidden.Ranchers aren t welcome to graze their thousands of head of cattle, because the land has been designated as a natural resource. It s a place where a natural ecosystem can actually survive without being decimated by cattle. Bundy would, of course, change that and with his intention to be there  for years  if necessary, you know he s thinking setting up a cattle operation might be a good idea.Miners aren t allowed to strip or tunnel, because it s been determined that the risk to the environment of that area is too great from the pollution mining inherently brings to streams and groundwater. You d think the ranchers would care about the heavy metal poisoning of their cattle, but for some reason they don t.Loggers aren t allowed to chop down the forest in an area like this for obvious reasons. Things live in trees, and in this area, this tiny protected little world of plants, animals, streams and ponds, living things are essential.The Bundy stance is about greed. It s about the mentality that just because you ve lived in a place a long time you have the right to destroy it. For private property that may be true; you may destroy your own property at will, but that land next door owned by the taxpayer? We have laws and such about that land. It isn t yours. These people have been mooching for free for so long off of the U.S. government   and therefore the taxpayer   that they would have no idea how to live on their own.Yes, these are the same people who call people getting food benefits  lazy.

Trump officials under fire over vague tax proposals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Missing from President Donald Trump’s budget proposal this week was an annual report, known as the Green Book, that presidents have issued for many years to spell out their tax goals in detail, an omission that tax experts called telling. The Green Book, named for the color of its cover in recent years, is not that big a deal as a document, but its absence this year shows that the Trump White House lacks a clear vision for what to do about overhauling the tax code, experts said. “I think it’s as simple as no tax plan equals no Green Book,” said Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, a liberal think tank. Democratic lawmakers on Thursday in two Senate hearings criticized the president’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal, released on Tuesday, and some of its core tax components. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen called the budget proposal and its tax assumptions “fantasy flim-flam.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing at one of the hearings, said the budget proposal did not consider how new tax laws would impact government revenues and the deficit because the Trump administration did not have a detailed tax proposal. “When the president’s budget was done, we were not ready to have a full-blown tax reform plan,” Mnuchin said, adding that tax details would be worked out with Congress, then made public. A Treasury Department official said separately it would not help to publish details while talks with Congress were underway. “Releasing a Green Book of tax policy proposals as we work towards comprehensive tax reform would contradict that effort,” the Treasury official said in an email. The last Green Book was issued by the Obama administration in February 2016 and ran 283 pages. Past Green Books going back to 1990 are available on the Treasury Department website. As a candidate, Trump, in his 125th day in power, promised voters that he would work with Congress and seek passage in his first 100 days of “massive tax reduction and simplification.” He has not yet offered any tax legislation. On April 26, the administration released a one-page list of tax proposals summarized in 12 bullet points. Tuesday’s budget repeated the one-page summary, including a proposal to end the estate tax on inheritances paid by a few wealthy Americans. Despite this policy position, the Trump budget included a projection of $328 billion in estate tax revenues for 2018-2027. “I’ve seen lots of tricky budgets before, but this may take the cake,” said Democratic Senator Mark Warner. “You assume abolishment of the so-called death tax, estate tax, but ... you still count the revenues from the estate and gift tax, which is kind of a tricky thing. I would call that double-counting.” ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2017 ",1
"Trump's EPA budget proposal targets climate, lead cleanup programs","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is proposing to slash a quarter of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s budget, targeting climate-change programs and those designed to prevent air and water pollution like lead contamination, a source with direct knowledge of the proposal said on Thursday. President Donald Trump has long signaled his intention to reverse former Democratic President Barack Obama’s climate-change initiatives. But the Republican president has vowed his planned overhaul of green regulation would not jeopardize America’s water and air quality. The 23-page 2018 budget proposal, which aims to slice the environmental regulator’s overall budget by 25 percent to $6.1 billion and staffing by 20 percent to 12,400 as part of a broader effort to fund increased military spending, would cut deeply into programs like climate protection, environmental justice and enforcement. Politico and other news outlets reported the staff and overall budget cuts earlier, but the source disclosed new details on the impact the cuts would have on programs and grants to states. Environmentalists slammed the proposed cuts, which must be approved by the Republican-led Congress. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the budget proposal or its counter proposal. The White House said it had no comment. Under the proposal, which was sent to the EPA this week, grants to states for lead cleanup would be cut 30 percent to $9.8 million, according to the source, who read the document to Reuters. Grants to help Native American tribes combat pollution would be cut 30 percent to $45.8 million. An EPA climate protection program on cutting emissions of greenhouse gases like methane that contribute to global warming would be cut 70 percent to $29 million. The proposal would cut funding for the brownfields industrial site cleanup program by 42 percent to $14.7 million. It would also reduce funding for enforcing pollution laws by 11 percent to $153 million.  The budget did not cut state revolving funds for programs, that Congress tapped last year to provide aid to Flint, Michigan, for its lead pollution crisis.   All staff at a research program, called Global Change Research, as well as 37 other programs would be cut under the plan. Some of the cuts are unlikely to pass the Republican-led Congress as they are popular with both Democrats and Republicans. Congress would be unlikely to approve a proposal to cut all staff in a diesel emissions program, for example.   Scott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, told U.S. mayors on Thursday he would make a priority of cleanups of industrial and hazardous waste sites and improving water infrastructure, even as the White House proposed severe proposed cuts to those programs. “In this budget discussion that is ongoing with Congress that is just starting, there are some concerns about some of these grant programs that EPA has been a part of historically,” Pruitt said. “I want you to know that with the White House and also with Congress, I am communicating a message that the brownfields program, the Superfund program and the water infrastructure grants and state revolving funds are essential to protect,” he said.   Greenpeace spokesman Travis Nichols said: “As a candidate, Trump made a big deal out of EPA’s failure in Flint, but now he’s cutting 30 percent out of lead cleanup in his proposed budget. This is an example of his empty promises to do right by the American people.” Officers of the Environmental Council of the States, composed of local regulators, raised concerns to the White House and EPA about the budget process, which they said lacked input by directly affected states. ECOS officers will meet with the environment team of the Office and Management and Budget, a White House office, on Friday and have slated a teleconference with Pruitt in March.  ECOS head Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said states had been hopeful after Pruitt’s confirmation hearing that they would get resources to do their work. “Now they are feeling very vulnerable,” she said.

"Kurds will find it hard to implement independence, says Iraqi foreign minister","CAIRO (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leaders must be prepared to face the consequences if they unilaterally declare independence and find implementation more difficult than they expected, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said on Wednesday. Jaafari was in Cairo for an Arab League summit where the closing statement included a resolution calling a Kurdish independence referendum this month unconstitutional, mirroring the stance of Iraq s central government and national parliament. Jaafari told Reuters in an interview Kurdish leaders should think carefully before going ahead with any independence move.  Those who make such a declaration should bear the responsibility for it. It is easy to declare whatever you want but it is not that easy to actualize it,  he said in his Cairo hotel room.  We are depending on dialogue and also Arab, and non-Arab advocacy. As we saw yesterday, the Arab diplomatic mobilization was attained by Arab foreign ministers,  he said. The Kurdish area of northern Iraq has enjoyed broad autonomy since the first Gulf War in 1991. Since the 2003 U.S-led invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, it has been largely stable while the rest of Iraq has suffered insurgency. Kurds are set to hold the referendum on Sept. 25 but Baghdad opposes it, with lawmakers voting to reject it. Iraq s neighbors   Turkey, Iran and Syria    also oppose the referendum, fearing it could fan separatism among their own ethnic Kurdish populations. Western powers are concerned a plebiscite in Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdish region - including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk - could divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants. Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the collapse of the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire. Iraq is in the final throws of a U.S.-backed campaign to oust the Sunni militant groups which seized vast swathes of the country back in 2014. Iraqi forces took back its second largest city, Mosul in July, and Tal Afar last month. Jaafari said the international community must offer financial and other support to Iraq for the rebuilding of Mosul and other cities retaken from Islamic State.  It is well known that nations who have emerged from war and destruction suffer great losses especially if the opposing party is implementing a scorched earth policy. (They) never surrendered land except after destroying it,  he said.  Homes, institutions, hospitals mosques, markets and worship places, all were destroyed. The money needed is not little, a great sum is required.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Kenya police use teargas, shoot in air during opposition march","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air on Monday as hundreds of demonstrators marched through the capital Nairobi to protest against proposed legal changes that would make it harder for the Supreme Court to annul an election. Reuters television footage showed a sport utility vehicle ploughing into some of the protesters, severely injuring three, but it was not immediately clear who was responsible and the police made no immediate comment on the incident.  Kenya is due on Oct. 26 to repeat a presidential election after the Supreme Court nullified an Aug. 8 vote due to procedural irregularities. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who won the August election, will face opposition leader Raila Odinga. Uncertainty over the coming election has created turmoil in the East African nation, which is a regional trade hub and staunch Western ally.  As the demonstrators marched toward the election board in Nairobi, a Reuters journalist saw men in plain clothes near security forces fire shots in the air. Police on horseback set up blockades to prevent protesters from accessing some roads.  Police also used teargas in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga s stronghold, to disperse protesters, though another demonstration in the coastal city of Mombasa passed peacefully. Odinga s opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the October vote unless the electoral board changes some personnel - a stance he declined on Monday to clarify, in comments that suggested he was keeping his options open for now.  This is a democratic society we live in. If I choose not to participate in the pre-rigged election process, it is my democratic right. No court can order me to do so,  Odinga said in comments broadcast on Kenyan TV stations, without elaborating further. The protesters want to warn ruling party lawmakers not to pass an amendment to the election law that would limit the circumstances in which the Supreme Court could void an election on procedural grounds, opposition lawmaker James Orengo said.   If parliament passes the law tomorrow, it will be like declaring war on the Kenyan people,  he said.  Justin Muturi, speaker of the National Assembly, said the amendment could be debated when parliament reconvenes on Tuesday if lawmakers were keen to push it forward.  He said the key part of the proposed law stipulates that if a candidate boycotts an election whose date has already been set, the remaining candidate would win the contest without formal polls being held. The government is keen to avoid a constitutional crisis if Odinga pulls out at the last minute, frustrating the court s order to hold elections within 60 days, Muturi said.   We are trying to prevent a crisis should there be no elections,  he told Reuters by phone.  The government-backed Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said on Monday in a report that at least 37 people had been killed in a police crackdown on protests that immediately followed the August vote - the highest death toll given so far. The report attributed some deaths to  police using live bullets and a few from police bludgeoning using clubs . It named a 6-month-old baby girl, a 7-year-old boy, and an 8-year-old girl as being among the victims. ",worldnews,"October 9, 2017 ",1
OSAMA BIN LADEN’S YOUNGEST WIFE Speaks Out For First Time: Tells Chaotic Story Of Night U.S. Navy SEALs Killed Her “Frightened” Husband,"The family of Osama bin Laden has spoken out for the first time about what it was like to watch the 9/11 mastermind and al-Qaeda terrorist die in a hail of US military gunfire.Amal bin Laden, the fourth and youngest wife of the man who was at the top of the US s most wanted list for over a decade, has recounted the story of the night he died at the hands of SEAL special forces.She and their six children lived in their  safe house  in the mountains of Abbottabad in Pakistan when bin Ladin was killed on May 11, 2011.Amal bin Laden told the story of the night to Cathy Scott-Clarke and Adrian Levy for their book The Exile: The Flight of Osama bin Laden, which has been excerpted in the Sunday Times UK.Along with Amal bin Laden and her children, also living in the house was bin Laden s second wife Khairiah and third wife Seham and son Khalid, 22.First wife Najwa had married him as a teen and bore him 11 children, but left him two days before the 9/11 attacks.By 11pm on May 1, 2011, after dinner, the dishes, and prayer, bin Laden was fast asleep while his fourth wife lie next to him.Outside, the streets were dark due to an electricity shortage, something that was a common occurrence in the area, but Amal awoke uneasily just past midnight.She heard a chop chop chop sound and thought she saw shadows dancing on the windows.Bin Laden sat up, looking frightened. Americans are coming,  he said, panting. Then there was a loud screeching noise and the house rocked.The pair clutched at each other and crept to the balcony. It was a moonless night and difficult to see,  Amal said.On the lawn, out of their sight, were two US military Black Hawks, and 24 SEALs were stealthily rushing over the lawn and towards the compound.Up on the second floor balcony, Seham and Khalid could see the Americans approaching.Bin Laden called to his son to come to him and, still in his pajamas, Khalid grabbed an AK-47, which Amal knew he hadn t fired since he was 13.Amal and Seham comforted the children, who were crying. They all went to the top floor and huddled.They heard a blast as the SEALs blew off the gate to the house. They want me, not you,  bin Laden finally said, telling his family to go downstairs. But oldest daughters Miriam and Sumaiya hid on the balcony while Seham and son Khalid went downstairs.Upstairs, Amal, bin Laden and their young son Hussein remained in the room and prayed. Amal said she realized someone within their inner circle had betrayed them.The SEALs were now in a hallway and blasted a locked door before heading upwards.One of the forces members, who spoke Arabic and knew what Khalid looked like, called to him, and when Khalid glanced over the balcony, he was shot.Sumaiya and Miriam rushed the SEALs but they were quickly flicked against a wall by the Arabic-speaking man.SEAL Robert O Neill walked past them and entered the room. Amal was in front of her husband. She rushed O Neill and was shot by someone as other SEALs entered the room.Amal felt pain tear through her leg and she collapsed onto the bed and passed out.O Neill would later describe shooting bin Laden, and thinking  He s going down .More SEALS crashed into the room and fired rounds into bin Laden.Meanwhile, Amal said she awoke but knew she had to play dead. She closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.Little Hussein, who had witnessed everything, was grabbed by a SEAL, and water was thrown in his face, according to Amal.She remained motionless as Miram and Sumaiya were grabbed by the forces and held over the bodies of their father, and voices demanded that they make an identification.At first Miriam gave a fake name, but Sumaiya said  Tell them the truth, they are not Pakastanis . My father,  Miriam said.  Osama bin Laden. Safiyah, then 11, was hiding on the balcony when he was also grabbed by a SEAL and told to make an identification. Safiyah was crying hysterically but told the men it was her father.Khairiah, who was in the hallway, was also grabbed by a SEAL.  Stop f***ing with me,  the SEAL yelled, according to the account.

 The US Supreme Court Has Bad News For The American People And The GOP Is To Blame,"The vacancy left by Scalia and the inevitable 4-4 ties bound to happen have left the court no choice but to deliver sorry and crippling news to the American public: The court will hear but a fraction of the cases it normally would in a session, with a mere three cases scheduled since Scalia died.The Supreme Court of the United States is tasked under article 3 section 2 with the power to decide all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, to interpret the laws of the nation and to be the final word in the legality of all of our treaties. The Judicial branch of the government determines precedent often over cases the people and their elected representatives can t agree on by interpreting their letter and spirit as it applies to our society as well as the intentions of the founders.That s quite a mouthful and a set of expectations that all too often fall by the wayside in favor of partisan politics. That s not to say that the court doesn t have its moments. Centrist judges and even partisan players have often taken their robes and their positions as seriously as they should, such as with the recent decisions on Obamacare subsidies and gay marriage. On the other hand, when you have to sit back and witness the destruction of the Voters Rights Act, once again the issue of partisanship comes into play. Partisan or not, the court is tasked with those decisions, and it has nine justices for a reason. Ties at the highest court of the land don t work.No matter how you view the court, its role in our government is imperative. The death of Justice Scalia and the obstructionist GOP-led senate hasn t just hampered the court s ability to function, it has rendered it nearly inoperable. Between late February and Early April, the court hears eight cases on average with a high of eleven in 2011.The reason is simple: The court isn t interested in wasting time by hearing cases that will end in a deadlock. It s counter-productive to maintaining the rule of law and a massive waste of time and resources. As a result, the court has heard cases with little consequence or controversy. The court has agreed to hear eight cases in total this term, which runs until January 2017, five of which were scheduled while Scalia was still alive. The court typically hears upwards of 70 cases in a term.That means we can forget about integral decisions on archaic abortion laws, redistricting, campaign reform, and a plethora of other issues already ruled on by lower conservative judges until sometime in 2017, or whenever the Democrats regain the Senate if Clinton or Sanders are elected this November. The Republican party doesn t play fair. Their tactics are bush league at best. By obstructing the executive branch and holding the judicial branch hostage, the GOP has effectively destroyed the republic they claim to be saving.Featured image by Win McNamara, Getty Images",News,"April 4, 2016",0

NO MORE FUN FREEBIES ON BACKS OF HARD WORKING AMERICANS: Kansas Takes “Fun” Activities Out Of Welfare,"Meanwhile, families with two full time working parents have been choosing generic cheerios from the cereal aisle at Kroger and forgoing vacations so welfare recipients can fill their leisure time with fun activities. If you re wondering how we ever got to this point, look no further than the Democrats freebies (on your dime) for votes scheme There s nothing fun about being on welfare, and a new Kansas law aims to keep it that way.Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signed House Bill 2258 into law Thursday. The measure means Kansas families receiving government assistance will no longer be able to use those funds to visit swimming pools, see movies, go gambling or get tattoos on the state s dime.Those are just a few of the restrictions contained within the law that aims to tighten regulations on how poor families spend their government aid. It will go into effect July 1.The measure   called the HOPE Act by supporters    provides an opportunity for success,  Brownback said in a statement after signing the bill.  It s about the dignity of work and helping families move from reliance on a government pittance to becoming self-sufficient by developing the skills to find a well-paying job and build a career. State Sen. Michael O Donnell, a Wichita Republican who has advocated for the bill, said the legislation was designed to pressure those receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to spend  more responsibly. We re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended,  O Donnell, vice chair of the state senate s standing committee on public health and welfare, told the Topeka Capital-Journal earlier this year.  This is about prosperity. This is about having a great life. That, according to the legislation, means limiting spending on body piercings, massages, spas, tobacco, nail salons, lingerie, arcades, cruise ships or visits to psychics. The measure   which limits TANF recipients from withdrawing more than $25 per day from ATMs   also forbids recipients from spending money at a: theme park, dog or horse racing facility, parimutuel facility, or sexually oriented business or any retail establishment which provides adult-oriented entertainment in which performers disrobe or perform in an unclothed state for entertainment, or in any business or retail establishment where minors under age 18 are not permitted. I just think we are simply saying to people,  If you are asking for assistance in this state, you re sort of less than other people and we re going to tell you how and where to spend your money,  state Rep. Carolyn Bridges, a Wichita Democrat, said during a House debate, according to the Associated Press.The Kansas House and Senate passed the bill April 2 with wide support from Republicans, who control both legislative chambers, according to the APVia: Washington Post",Government News,"Apr 20, 2015",0
Former Obama aide calls Trump a 'psychopath',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former top adviser to President Barack Obama on Sunday labeled Donald Trump a “psychopath”, saying the Republican presidential nominee met the clinical definition of the personality disorder. With a little more than two months to go before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, the comments by David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and manager of his 2008 presidential campaign, mark another escalation in a series of blows exchanged between Trump’s camp and that of his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton. “Basically, you have a psychopath running for president. I mean, he meets the clinical definition,” Plouffe said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press”. When challenged, Plouffe acknowledged he had no degree in psychology but rattled off what he said were the New York businessman’s symptoms: “grandiose notion of self-worth; pathological lying; lack of empathy and remorse.” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last week, Clinton accused Trump of fueling America’s “radical fringe” with racist rhetoric, while Trump said Clinton was letting down black Americans with failed policies and called her a “bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings.” Obama has also lambasted Trump, saying of him: “Somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn’t have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.”  ",politicsNews,"August 28, 2016 ",1

 That Time Donald Trump Posed As His Own Spokesman To Brag About Himself (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is pretty terrible. He s exactly the sort of person who would suggest that Muslims be banned from entering the United States. He s the type of guy who would force any Muslims in the United States to register in a national database and wear special badges, then throw them in concentration camps as a  temporary measure. Trump has spoken openly about building a wall between the United states and Mexico to keep brown people out, openly encouraged his supporters to beat African-Americans at his rallies. Hell, he even has been known to keep a book of Hitler s speeches by his bedside for light reading. He s repeatedly lied throughout his campaign in an effort to paint himself as the best option to serve as President of the United States. But the Washington Post has revealed yet another facet of Trump s douchebaggery: he s also the type of guy who would pretend to be his own public relations  person so he can talk himself up.The Washington Post has uncovered an old recording of what sounds like The Donald talking himself up while speaking to reporters. The recording is from 1991, and is between the now-GOP nominee   sorry,  John Miller    and a reporter from People Magazine. Sue Caswell was covering Trump s media circus-of-the-time   his divorce from Ivana Trump, who says her former husband brutally raped her in just one of the many incidents that led to the end of their marriage as well as his relationship with Marla Maples.The  spokesman  had some interesting insight into Trump s personal life, telling Caswell that he  really didn t want to make a commitment  to Maples because he s  coming out of a marriage, and he s starting to do tremendously well financially.  He assured Caswell that Trump is a  good guy  who isn t  going to hurt anybody  and  treated his wife well    you know, aside from the horrific abuse, and all: Have you met him?  He s a good guy and he s not going to hurt anybody.  The one article said he was going to throw her out of the apartment is total nonsense.  He is going to always treat her well as he treated his wife well.  I mean, he paid his wife a great deal of money.  He did it in a very bad period of time and, ultimately, that was settled.  There were those that say that that was even put that way.  I don t know if you heard that but that Trump became poor until he got his divorce.  And then all of a sudden, he s been doing very well and I guess you probably heard that, too.But he treated his wife well and he treated   and he will treat Marla well.  He s somebody that has a lot of options, and, frankly, he gets called by everybody. He gets called by everybody in the book, in terms of women. Trump explained that he is  sort of handling PR because [Trump] gets so much of it,  and that he was simply doing the PR gig  part-time,  and even took the time to regail Caswell with a tale of the time he met Madonna.Other reporters say they received similarly suspicious calls from  Miller  or  John Barron,  and those reporters all say Trump was the person behind the calls. In fact, some of his top aides and Trump himself have confirmed that he was doing his own PR work. In 1991, People reported:Just two weeks ago, though, Ms. Maples was not even taking The Donald s calls. Not after a PEOPLE reporter played her a tape on June 26 of a man saying that he was a Trump publicist named John Miller. A shocked, devastated Marla identified the voice as that of Trump himself. He announced, among other things, that he d traded in his Georgia peach for an Italian model (Carla Bruni).  When I heard his voice on that tape saying those things, I said,  Whoa! Uh-uh. No more,    says Marla.  If he could say all that stuff and act like it s cool to have this playboy image, then oh my gosh, all I could say was,  Baby, you re on your own.   So she packed a bag, ducking the press as well as The Donald s persistent appeals to reconcile, and took refuge at the Greenwich, Conn., home of her close friend, morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gilford. There she talked, prayed (she and Kathie Lee are both devout Christians) and came to a Donald-less conclusion:  I realized I was not going to die without this person in my life. Meanwhile a penitent Don Juan-ald had come to the opposite conclusion. The John Miller fiasco he called a joke gone awry.  What I did became a good time at Mar-la s expense, and I m very sorry,  says the newly humbled tycoon. As for his wandering eye,  I d felt that I needed space and freedom after the divorce, so I took the opportunity to go out with other women, but I kept coming back to Marla. I realized, why go looking for something when you already have exactly what you want? Despite all of this, on Friday Trump denied that he was the guy behind the calls. I don t know anything about it,  Trump said during an appearance on NBC s Today: I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice, and you can imagine that. This sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. It doesn t sound like me. It was not me on the phone,  he rambled.  And it doesn t sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that. It was not me on the phone. Hear that folks? It wasn t him on the phone. It wasn t him with a bone. It wasn t him on a train. It wasn t him on a plane. It wasn t him on a boat, in a moat, or you get the idea. Sure, he may have admitted it in the past, but he s running for President now. Why tell the truth? This was so farcical, that he pretended to be his own publicist. Here was this so-called billion-dollar real estate mogul, and he can t hire his own publicist,  Carswell said upon listening to the tape for the first time in more than two decades.  It also said something about the control he wanted to keep of the news cycle flowing with this story, and I can t believe he thought he d get away with it. Unfortunately, he keeps getting away with things. Despite his horrific remarks, his repeated lies, and his generally awful attitude, The Donald has managed to land himself the spot as the 2016 GOP nominee. Republicans have repeatedly given him a pass no matter what he says or does because he represents all that is terrible about our society   bigotry, hatred, racism, xenophobia   and that is exactly what appeals to them.Compared to Trump s numerous other lies this is a small one, but it does show how important it is to him that he controls the narrative.Listen to the call below:Featured image via Getty Images/Isaac Brekken",News,"May 13, 2016",0
WHY FORD’S DARK SECRET May Come Back To Haunt Them Over Owner’s Support of NFL Protests,"Founder of the Ford Motor Company, Henry Ford, made no secret of the fact that he disliked Jewish people. More precisely, he disliked  the Jew    an abstract impression of what Ford imagined to be a sinister people bent on controlling the world.Not only did he make no secret of his contempt, but he launched a weekly newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, in 1919 to promote his paranoid views. He pressed Ford retailers to sell subscriptions.In the end, historians say, Ford assisted some of the greatest evil and genocide in history by fueling the anti-Semitism of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in the 1920s. According to press reports, Hitler had a portrait of Henry Ford on his office wall and a copy of The International Jew, published by Ford, on his desk.   Crains Business Detroit Should anyone be shocked by a Sheriff s decision to not want to support a car brand, after their decision to openly support a movement started to create hate and distrust for our law enforcement? The Bossier Parish (La.) Sheriff s Office is boycotting its local Ford dealership because of Ford Motor Company s support for protests of the National Anthem by National Football League (NFL) players at games, Sheriff Julian Whittington announced Wednesday.Sheriff Whittington sent a letter to Hixson Ford of Alexandria notifying the dealership that his office would no longer purchase Ford vehicles for  as long as Ford sides with those who have no regard for the men and women who protect and serve this great nation : Yes, the NFL players have a right to protest as they deem necessary, but we, the Bossier Sheriff s Office and the taxpayers of Bossier Parish have a right to spend our money elsewhere,  Whittington says in his letter posted on the office s Facebook page. It is my hope that this letter will cause you to encourage Ford Motor Co. to change their advertising choice and cease to support the NFL with advertising dollars until the NFL leadership demands its players show proper respect for our nation s colors.  After the letter to Hixson Automotive was received by Dallas L. Hixson, the Sheriff discussed the issue with Mr. Hixson, the Sheriff s office told CNSNews.com. Mr. Hixson informed Sheriff Whittington that he was not aware of Ford Motor Company s support for NFL players who wish to protest during the National Anthem or during the game.Hixson told Sheriff Whittington that such a stance concerns him as well, and he will be taking the Sheriff s letter with him to Detroit to present to Ford Motor Co. leadership in the near future.Sheriff Whittington says he is sending copies of the letter to each of the state s 63 other sheriffs, as well as both the national and Louisiana sheriffs  associations.National Sheriffs  Association (NSA) Executive Director Jonathan Thompson tells CNSNews.com that NSA has received the letter and that sheriffs have both the authority and obligation to authorize, or decline, purchases based on the best interests of law enforcement and their communities: Sheriffs have the obligation to decide which products they authorize for bids, procurements and purchases. They choose, based upon a variety of requirements and capabilities, but also whom they believe is best able to support the broad needs of law enforcement and the communities they protect  Since 2016, the Bossier Sheriff s Office has spent $747,132 and purchased 29 vehicles patronizing Hixon Autoplex. The Sheriff s Office provided the following breakdown to CNSNews.com:In 2016, BSO purchased 14 vehicles from Hixson Autoplex, costing $346,519.50. They included:One 2015 Ford F-150 Two 2015 Ford F-250 Six 2017 Ford Police Interceptor One 2017 Ford Explorer Three 2016 Ford Taurus One 2017 Ford Taurus In 2017, BSO purchased 15 vehicles from Hixson Autoplex, costing $400,612.50.

CASTRO IGNORES DISASTROUS COMMUNIST POLICIES That Destroyed Cubans: Blames World Leaders At UN Assembly For Allowing Millions To Go Hungry,"If Obama had a communist friend he d be this poor victim Raul Castro the champion of human rights and justice What a dog and pony show.Cuban leader Raul Castro used his first speech before the United Nations General Assembly to lash out at the international body, saying Monday that member states have failed to produce much beyond an  illusion  of the human rights, justice and development promised in the charter.Castro made scant mention of last summer s landmark restoration of ties with the United States after a five-decade break, instead delivering a searing indictment of world superpowers for allowing millions to remain hungry, illiterate and at risk of death by curable illnesses while annual military expenses worldwide amount to more than $1.7 trillion. Barely a fraction of that figure could resolve the most pressing problems afflicting humanity,  Castro said.Castro received warm applause and scattered cheers when he made his U.N. debut, and several Latin American and African leaders gave him a standing ovation at the end of his remarks, in apparent approval of his narrative that Western colonialism and imperialism are at the roots of today s conflicts. He didn t name names, but his allusions to the United States and its allies were clear as he criticized invasions and overthrows, the  selective and discriminatory  approach to human rights, and the threat of climate change stemming from  an irrational and unsustainable consumerism. There have constantly been wars of aggression and interference in the internal affairs of the states, the ousting of sovereign governments by force, the so-called  soft coups  and the recolonization of territories,  Castro said.Via: McClatchyDC",politics,"Sep 29, 2015",0
 Rabbi Michael Lerner DESTROYS Trump In Brilliant Speech At Ali Funeral (VIDEO),"When we lost boxing legend Mohammed Ali this week, we lost more than an athlete. We lost a humanitarian, a man who was a great example to people all over the world of what being a leader and an all around decent human being means. Therefore, it is only fitting that his public funeral be a place to remind everyone what this great man was about, and what we as people should   and should not   aspire to be. That is just what Rabbi Michael Lerner did in a speech that brought the house down at Ali s funeral on Friday.Lerner took to the stage and declared that he was there as a  representative of American Jews.  After that, he turned his attentions to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Without mentioning the orange buffoon by name, Lerner said: We will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down Muslims and blaming Muslims for a few people. We know what it s like to be demeaned. We know what it s like to have a few people who act against the highest vision of our tradition to then be identified as the value of the entire tradition. Of course, this was a clear reference to Trump s appalling call to ban Muslims from the United States. Lerner wasn t done yet, though. He went on to trumpet the praises of a Clinton victory in November, and also insisted that we need to make the world a more equal place for all. He continued: Tell the next president of the United States that she should seek a constitutional amendment to make all national and state elections funded by Congress and the state legislatures, and all other sources of money be banned   including money from corporations, from individuals. Make it all public funding. Tell her that the way to achieve homeland security is not for us to try new ways of domination. The strategy of domination of The world of  the other  to get security has been tried for the last 10,000 years and it doesn t work. The way to get security is for the United States to become known as the most generous and caring country in the world, not the most powerful. Well said, Rabbi Lerner.

Turkish PM calls Rohingya killings in Myanmar 'genocide',"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Turkey s prime minister on Wednesday dubbed the killing of minority Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar by its security forces  genocide  and urged the international community to ensure their safety back home. Binali Yildirim met several Rohingyas in two refugee camps in Cox s Bazar in neighboring Bangladesh. Almost 870,000 Rohingya fled there, about 660,000 of whom arrived after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive.  The Myanmar military has been trying to uproot Rohingya Muslim community from their homeland and for that they persecuted them, set fire to their homes, villages, raped and abused women and killed them,  Yildirim told reporters from Cox s Bazar, before flying back to Turkey.  It s one kind of a genocide,  he said.  The international community should also work together to ensure their safe and dignified return to their homeland,  Yildirim, who was accompanied by Bangladesh s Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, said. Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug. 25, MSF said last week. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has called the violence  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place. Yildirim inaugurated a medical camp at Balukhali, sponsored by Turkey, and handed over two ambulances to Cox s Bazar district administration. He also distributed food to Rohingya refugees at Kutupalong makeshift camp. He urged the international community to enhance support for Rohingyas in Bangladesh and help find a political solution to this humanitarian crisis. U.N. investigators have heard Rohingya testimony of a  consistent, methodical pattern of killings, torture, rape and arson . The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria. Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar s transition after decades of military rule. Yildirim s trip follows Turkish first lady Emine Erdogan s visit in September to the Rohingya camp, when she said the crack down in Myanmar s Rakhine state was  tantamount to genocide  and a solution to the Rohingya crisis lies in Myanmar alone.

Clinton’s ‘No-Fly Zone’ over Syria Will Not “Save Lives” – It Will Lead to War with Russia,"Prof Michel Chossudovsky Global ReaseachThe media has failed to address the confrontation between the U.S. State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Francis Dunford (image, left) has warned both the US Senate as well Secretary of State John Kerry in no uncertain terms that a  No Fly Zone  over Syria would lead to war with both Syria and Russia, intimating a dangerous process of military escalation.In a Senate Arms Services Committee hearing, Dunford said, responding to questions from Republican Senator Roger Whicker (Mississippi): Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia  That s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I m not going to make.

U.S. conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly dead at 92,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Phyllis Schlafly, who became a “founding mother” of the modern U.S. conservative movement by battling feminists in the 1970s and working tirelessly to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, died on Monday at the age of 92, her Eagle Forum group said. Schlafly, who lived in the St. Louis suburb of Ladue, Missouri, died at her home in the presence of her family, Eagle Forum said in a statement. The cause of death was not given. She was still a conservative force and popular speaker in her 90s, endorsing Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and praising his policy on immigration. She was a delegate to the Republicans’ convention in Cleveland. Trump said in a statement that he spoke with Schlafly a few weeks ago by telephone “and she sounded as resilient as ever ... She was a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength.” Schlafly once called feminists “a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems,” Time said, while insisting that “women find their greatest fulfillment at home with their family.” Her political ardor did not fade with age and in 2014, as President Barack Obama pushed for pay equity for women, Schlafly sparked controversy with a column for the Christian Post saying a man’s paycheck comes first. “The pay gap between men and women is not all bad because it helps to promote and sustain marriages,” she said. “... The best way to improve economic prospects for women is to improve job prospects for the men in their lives, even if that means increasing the so-called pay gap.” Schlafly promoted traditional family values and once told a reporter that she always listed her occupation as “mother” when filling out applications. But she was hardly a typical stay-at-home housewife/mother. Shortly after marrying lawyer Fred Schlafly in 1949, she became active in Republican Party politics in Alton, Illinois, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice. She would go on to found the Eagle Forum grass-roots conservative group, write a newspaper column and newsletter and author some 20 books. Her crowning achievement was crusading to prevent the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the U.S. Constitution and it made Schlafly a leader in the modern American conservative movement. “Phyllis Schlafly courageously and single-handedly took on the issue of the Equal Rights Amendment when no one else in the country was opposing it,” said James C. Dobson, chairman and founder of Focus on the Family. “In so doing, she essentially launched the pro-family, pro-life movement.” Biographer Donald T. Critchlow said defeating the ERA helped usher in a conservative era in American politics and boosted Ronald Reagan to the presidency. In her decade-long fight against the ERA, Schlafly traveled across the country to speak at rallies and persuade state legislators not to approve the ERA.  Along the way she often debated feminist writer Betty Freidan, who called Schlafly “a traitor to her sex” and once told her: “I’d like to burn you at the stake.” The intention of the ERA was to ensure women were treated the same as men under state and federal laws. Schlafly’s attack on the proposed amendment was based on the premise that the rights of women already were well protected by the U.S. Constitution. She said the ERA actually would erode women’s standing, leading to homosexual marriages, women in combat, government-funded abortions and loss of alimony. In 1972 she started the Eagle Forum, now located in Clayton, Missouri, along with Stop ERA, bringing in legions of supporters who had been regarded as non-political housewives. In a 1978 appearance at the Illinois capitol she was accompanied by backers bearing loaves of home-made bread. Described by Time magazine as “feminine but forceful” and with her hair always carefully styled, Schlafly said she attended 41 state hearings to testify against the Equal Rights Amendment. When the ERA’s ratification deadline expired in 1982, having been approved by only 35 of the 38 states needed, Schlafly threw a party in Washington. Phyllis Stewart was born Aug. 15, 1924, in St. Louis and grew up in a home she described as Republican but not activist. She put herself through Washington University by firing weapons as an ammunition factory tester and later earned a master’s degree in political science from Radcliffe. In 1978 she graduated from Washington University’s law school. The left attacked Schlafly for promoting domestic life to her supporters while spending so much time pursuing her ambitious political agenda. She responded by saying she never told women they should not work. “I simply didn’t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women’s rights,” Schlafly told the New York Times. Schlafly first became a political presence with her 1964 self-published book “A Choice, Not an Echo,” which championed the conservative politics of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater. Schlafly also built a reputation as a strident anti-Communist and opponent of arms control treaties. After the ERA’s defeat, she continued to preach conservative causes such as limited government, anti-abortion laws, traditional education, strong defense and keeping out illegal immigrants. She frequently criticized immigration reform and the Obama administration and wrote more than 25 books. Schlafly also was a critic of gay rights, which proved to be a sensitive topic in 1992 when the oldest of her six children, John, who worked for the Eagle Forum, acknowledged he was homosexual. Schlafly’s husband Fred died in 1993. She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, Eagle Forum said. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
Hawaii renews bid to narrow Trump travel ban,"(Reuters) - The state of Hawaii renewed its bid to narrow President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban, following court rulings which said the state had taken the wrong procedural approach in attempts to challenge the administration’s policy earlier this week. In a court filing late on Friday, Hawaii’s attorney general asked a Honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible “bona fide relationship” with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.  Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Earlier this week Hawaii had asked a Honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the Supreme Court’s ruling to allow grandparents into the United States. The judge, along with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the Supreme Court’s opinion. However, the 9th Circuit on Friday said the courts could issue an injunction against Trump’s policy in the future, if the government misapplied the Supreme Court’s ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. Hours after that ruling, Hawaii made such an injunction request in a Honolulu federal court. Hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by Trump’s guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: Cambodia says opposition party could be barred from election,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s government has raised the possibility that the main opposition party could be ruled out of elections if it does not replace its leader, Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has said it will not replace its leader and the comments reinforced its fears that Prime Minister Hun Sen plans to cripple it before next year s elections. The arrest of Kem Sokha on Sunday drew Western condemnation and marked an escalation in a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, who has ruled for 30 years and could face possibly his toughest electoral challenge from the CNRP next year.  They have to appoint an acting president,  government spokesman Phay Siphan told Reuters on Tuesday.  If they don t comply with the law, they will not exist and have no right to political activity... It s their choice, not my choice.  Kem Sokha s daughter, Kem Monovithya, who is also a party official, said the party would not appoint a new leader. Kem Sokha was only named in February after his predecessor resigned in fear the party would be banned if he stayed on.  The ruling party can drop their divide-and-conquer plan now,  she said. Opposition officials accuse Hun Sen of trying to weaken or destroy the party ahead of the election, after it did well in June local elections, in which it nonetheless came well behind Hun Sen s Cambodia People s Party. Hun Sen, one of Asia s longest serving rulers, said on Wednesday there could be more arrests after  the act of treason  and it had reinforced the need for him to stay in office.  I ve decided to continue my work - not less than 10 years more,  he told garment factory workers, jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis. Kem Sokha became leader after opposition veteran Sam Rainsy resigned because of a new law that forbids any party having a leader who is found guilty of a crime. Sam Rainsy fled into exile to avoid a defamation conviction he says was political. Cambodian law says a political party has 90 days to replace a president if he or she dies, resigns or is convicted of an offence. Western countries have condemned the arrest of Kem Sokha and a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, including independent media.  We don t care about people outside,  Phay Siphan said.  We care about our national security. We don t belong to anyone.  China, Hun Sen s close ally, has voiced support for Cambodia on steps to ensure its security. Kem Sokha was formally charged with treason on Tuesday. His lawyers have dismissed the evidence presented against him so far - a video publicly available since 2013 - in which he tells supporters he is getting support and advice from Americans for the campaign to win elections.      The government and the ruling CPP have manufactured these treason charges against Kem Sokha for political purposes, aiming to try and knock the political opposition out of the ring before the 2018 electoral contest even begins,  said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch.

New Zealand's 'kingmaker' to start talks with both major parties this week,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The New Zealand First Party, which emerged as a kingmaker after New Zealand s election in September, will begin preliminary talks with both the ruling National Party and separately with the Labour Party this week, according to a media release. The statement comes after Prime Minister Bill English told media on Monday that he had called New Zealand First leader Winston Peters but he had not picked up. Both parties have since said the two leaders had spoken by telephone. While English s National Party won a 10-point lead over the opposition Labour Party in the Sept. 23 election, neither won enough seats to govern alone and both have been left courting the outspoken Peters to form a government. English s National Party secured 58 seats, only just short of the 61 seats needed to form a government in New Zealand s proportional representation system. Labour won 45 seats, New Zealand First won nine and the Green Party seven.  Preliminary talks will proceed this week when arrangements suitable to both parties are concluded,  the New Zealand First Party said on its website. It is a familiar situation for Peters. The veteran politician is holding the balance of power for a third time, having previously joined coalitions led by both National and Labour. While his policies are thought to have more in common with those of Labour - both want to curb immigration - some analysts say he could opt for National as it would be a simpler coalition of just two parties. Labour, however, would have to form a three-way coalition which would include the Green Party, with which it already has a working agreement. There was speculation over the weekend that the National Party could sound out the Greens, but English said he was undecided.  I think the Greens would need to show that there is a serious possibility of negotiation,  English told local media.  So far Mr. Peters has indicated that he is willing and able to negotiate, including with National, the Greens haven t indicated that so far...the Greens are pretty committed to working with Labour alone.  James Shaw, the leader of the Green Party, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, who boosted her party s chances after  taking over as leader in August, said she had spoken to Peters earlier and confirmed that their teams were looking to meet this week.  We will look to hold a meeting between our respective teams later this week, while we wait for special votes to be counted,  Ardern said in an emailed statement. A final tally of the results is due on Oct. 7, when  special votes , which make up 15 percent of the total and include overseas votes, are released. ",worldnews,"October 2, 2017 ",1
"Trump says unnamed country plans to build, expand five U.S. auto plants","INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday an unnamed foreign leader told him at the United Nations last week that the country would soon announce plans to build or expand five automobile industry factories in the United States. “I just left the United Nations last week and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they are going to be announcing in the not too distant future five major factories in the United States, between increasing and new, five,” Trump said in a speech on tax reform in Indianapolis. He added the factories were in the automotive industry.  Trump did not name the country or its leader. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and 12 other leaders in New York at the U.N. General Assembly meeting last week, but did not meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel who was in Germany ahead of an election. Automakers in Japan and Germany have both announced investments in the United States this year, with companies coming under pressure from Trump’s bid to curb imports and hire more workers to build cars and trucks in the U.S.  Investments to expand U.S. vehicle production capacity also reflect intensified competition for market share in the world’s most profitable vehicle market. In August, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said it would build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant with Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T). Toyota also said this week it was investing nearly $375 million in five U.S. manufacturing plants to support U.S. production of hybrid powertrains. Last week, German automaker Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) said it would spend $1 billion to expand its Mercedes Benz operations near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to produce batteries and electric sport utility vehicles and create more than 600 jobs.    Rival German luxury automaker BMW AG (BMWG.DE) said in June it would expand its U.S. factory in South Carolina, adding 1,000 jobs.  And last month, Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) brand president Herbert Diess said the company expected to bring electric SUV production to the United States and could add production at its Tennessee plant.

" Republicans Say Everything’s Terrible Because Of Obama, Show Them THIS And Shut Them Up","Republicans insist that everything under President Obama is awful and terrible and getting worse. Their nominee for the presidency has based his entire candidacy on the idea that America is a complete trianwreck and only he  alone  can fix things.But when you ask actual Americans about what their lives are like after eight years of Barack Obama being president, a completely different message emerges. Gallup did just that, in a survey of over 100,000 people, and almost completely across the board people feel better off than they did before.In 2008, fewer than half of Americans said their life was good enough to be considered  thriving,  according to Gallup. But that s changed:  The 55.4% who are thriving so far in 2016 is on pace to be the highest recorded in the nine years Gallup and Healthways have tracked it,  according to the report.The report even has findings that obliterate Donald Trump s constant harping that black Americans are living lives of complete desperation inside crack-destroyed inner city ghettos. The percentages of U.S. whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians who are thriving have all increased during the Obama era,  Gallup notes. The percentage of blacks thriving has risen by about 6 points, as has the percentage of whites and Hispanics. Asian thriving has risen by about 10 points since 2008.It isn t magic or left wing propaganda. People simply feel better off and more optimistic, and it isn t a coincidence that this change has occurred between the presidency of a conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat.As a result, President Obama s approval rating has gone over 50 percent and reports are now emerging that Trump is having trouble convincing voters in key states that they need to turn the page from Obama because people are feeling positive about the situation in America.Ignore the hype and noise of the right, check out the data and you ll learn how people really feel.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 31, 2016",0

Iraq readies for final offensive on Islamic State near Syrian border,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces are about to launch an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, the military said on Wednesday.  Your security forces are now coming to liberate you,  said leaflets dropped by the Iraqi air force on the western border region of al-Qaim and Rawa, according to a statement from the Joint Operations Command in Baghdad.  The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia. Islamic State s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months.  The militants  Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces last week. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks.  God is with us in this last assault on Daesh members,  said the leaflets dropped by the Iraqi forces on the border area with Syria, referring to Islamic State.   Tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately, and to go to any house on top of which a white flag have been raised when the liberation forces enter al-Qaim.

Red Cross says staff member killed in South Sudan ambush,"JUBA (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Saturday one of its drivers was shot dead when a convoy of their vehicles was ambushed in South Sudan s Western Equatoria State. The ICRC said Lukudu Kennedy Laki Emmanuel was killed when the convoy of nine trucks and a four-wheel-drive vehicle was shot at by unidentified gunmen while returning from Western Equatoria on Friday.  We are shaken and distraught by the killing of our colleague who was traveling in a convoy of vehicles which were clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem,  Fran ois Stamm, ICRC s head of delegation in Juba, said in a statement. The Western Equatoria region borders Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. South Sudan  became independent from neighboring Sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict. The new nation slid into civil war less than two years later, after President Salva Kiir fired his deputy, Riek Machar.       The conflict has often followed along ethnic lines, killing tens of thousands and forcing nearly a third of the population of 12 million to flee their homes, with Uganda alone hosting 1 million South Sudanese refugees. South Sudan also continues to be one of the most dangerous places for aid workers.  Since the conflict began in December 2013, at least 82 aid workers have been killed, including 17 in 2017 - most of them South Sudanese, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA).   Since January, 27 security-related incidents have forced the relocation of some 300 aid workers. These incidents signify a worsening operating environment for humanitarians in South Sudan,  the UN OCHA said in a statement on Friday. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1

HIDDEN ORDER: Was the Death of Justice Scalia Linked to ‘Secret Society’ at Cibolo Ranch?,"Shawn Helton   21st Century WireWith the United States in the heat of the 2016 presidential election cycle, key questions surrounding the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia continue to persist  as there s a new conspiratorial twist added to an already suspicious case.Recently, here at 21WIRE, we discussed many of the strange circumstances observed in the aftermath of Justice Scalia s death. The 79-year-old conservative justice was found dead in his hotel room at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury ranch located in Presidio County, Texas.There was no official autopsy made by a medical examiner in Scalia s death, only a controversial pronouncement over the phone by Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara.As 21WIRE pointed out in an earlier report regarding Scalia, Guevara appears to have reversed her previous statement claiming that Scalia had died of a  heart attack , revising the cause of death to  natural causes.  Guevara s handling of the death scene of a Supreme Court Justice without being present has drawn sharp criticism from both the media and the public.  ORIGINAL MEANING  Controversial conservative firebrand, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Secret Order, Secret Death?On February 24th, The Washington Post published an article entitled  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of this secretive society of elite hunters : When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 12 days ago at a West Texas ranch, he was among high-ranking members of an exclusive fraternity for hunters called the International Order of St. Hubertus, an Austrian society that dates back to the 1600s. Continuing, The Washington Post confirmed that indeed, the FBI will not be conducting an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Scalia s death. On an interesting note however, the article states that the FBI was unaware of the secretive international order all together: Law enforcement officials told The Post that they had no knowledge of the International Order of St. Hubertus or its connection to Poindexter and ranch guests. The officials said the FBI had declined to investigate Scalia s death when they were told by the marshals that he died from natural causes.   CLOAK & DAGGER    Members of The International Order of Saint Hubertus, from left: John Kotts, Boysie Bollinger, Vidal Martinez, Reed Morian and John Poindexter. (Photo link chron)The Washington Post article also revealed the identity of Scalia s travel partners:  C. Allen Foster, a prominent Washington lawyer who traveled to the ranch with Scalia by private plane,  and that Cibolo Creek Ranch owner John Poindexter, along with C. Allen Foster, had flown with Scalia to the ranch for the now infamous quail-hunting trip.Also according to the Post, both Poindexter and Foster,  hold leadership positions within the [Saint Hubertus] Order. It is unclear what, if any, official association Scalia had with the group. While the Post acknowledged that many of the 35 guests in attendance at Cibolo Creek Ranch have remained largely unknown to the public eye, they discuss some of the details surrounding the St. Hubertus order, an international brotherhood whose founding member, Count Franz Anton von Sporck , also started a branch of Freemasonry in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic): Members of the worldwide, male-only society wear dark-green robes emblazoned with a large cross and the motto  Deum Diligite Animalia Diligentes,  which means  Honoring God by honoring His creatures,  according to the group s website. The conspiratorial coincidence doesn t end there, it was also revealed that  The society s [Saint Hubertus] U.S. chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco.   CIBOLO CONSPIRACY    What really happened to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo link twitter)Magic Bullets Become  Magic Pillows Another bizarre element to this story, was the description and discovery of Scalia s body when it was first found by Cibolo Creek ranch owner, Poindexter. This aspect of the story is illustrated very clearly in a passage from the blog Followship of the Minds: On February 14, 2016, in an article for mySA (MySanAntonio) titled,  Texas Ranch owner recalls Scalia s last hours, reporter John MacCormack quoted Poindexter: We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head.Everything was in perfect order. He was in his pajamas, peacefully, in bed. His bed clothes were unwrinkled. He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap. On February 17, Poindexter  clarified  his comment to the New York Daily News that  There was a pillow over his head, not over his face. The face was entirely clear. And now, the latest.David Warren reports for the AP that according to a Presidio County Sheriff s Office incident report obtained by The Washington Post on Feb. 23, nothing appeared out of place around Scalia s bed. Three pillows were stacked to elevate Scalia s head. A top pillow appeared to have toppled onto his eyes and forehead but didn t appear positioned to impede his breathing.  Scalia s  arms were at his side atop the bed covers, which were pulled up to his chin. The bed covers were smooth and creased and showed no sign of a struggle. That is one magic pillow!First, it was over Scalia s head.Then, it was above Scalia s head, whose face was  entirely clear .Now, the pillow is neither over nor above Scalia s head, but partially covering his face ( toppled onto his eyes and forehead ), although the pillow made sure to position itself so as not to  impede his breathing .   SECRETS IN CIBOLO    The scenic surroundings of Cibolo Creek Ranch. (Photo link tripadvisor)While you have to wonder about the confusion surrounding Scalia s pillow placement, The Washington Post s recent eye-opening revelations regarding the Order of St. Hubertus   give us some other things to consider Silencing Conspiracy with ConspiracyThe overtly conspiracy-tinged Post piece is a rarity in the mainstream world, one that conjure s many Hollywood or government tales of murder, deception and intrigue throughout history.The acknowledgement of a decadent Eyes Wide Shut-like  secret society  on location at Cibolo Creek Ranch prior to Scalia s death, only enhances the drive by voyeurism witnessed since his passing and in a way, it could undermine any legitimate investigation into his death after the fact.While its true, this compelling new detail will most likely bring its lion s share of political protest, as well as predictable calls for congressional inquiry or a push for a federal investigation (as should be)   the heavily publicized presence of a secretive fraternal order of hunters nearby a suspicious crime scene, will unfortunately fuel more speculation.Put another way: Whether or not the secret group at Cibolo Creek Ranch was involved in Scalia s death, you have to wonder why the mainstream media revealed this latest conspiratorial element in the first place.Media gatekeepers in television, print and radio will have a field day with this new controversial piece, all the while pushing and pulling the population into a particular corner   and by the looks of it, that s already happening.Having said all of this however, there s still much to be concerned with regarding Scalia s highly suspicious death   OBAMA NO-SHOW    The funeral service for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Oddly, President Obama elected not to attend. (Photo link detroitnewstime)Big Questions RemainOver the years, Scalia s various political connections and political perspective on important issues earned him a controversial reputation.In 2014, Justice Scalia drew harsh criticism for his views on the CIA torture debate, when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the interrogation techniques used since the 9/11 attacks.Whether you agreed or disagreed with Scalia, it s important to note once again that the high court has several pending landmark cases on climate, abortion and immigration, all within weeks or months of his death.The NY Post s recent article entitled  Scalia could have been poisoned: forensic pathologist, raised even more questions about the state of Scalia s body upon being discovered: Lethal poisoning could have left Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s body in virtually the same condition in which it was found, a top forensic pathologist [Dr. Michael Baden] told The Post on Wednesday.
